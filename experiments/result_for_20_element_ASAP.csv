15385,5176738,3,"Everyone has their own opinion on the way our Presidents are elected. Some say they would prefer popular votes rather than electoral votes, while others believe we should keep it the same way. I believe that it is more fair and less kayotic having popular votes rather than electoral votes. I believe that popular votes keep it fair when it comes to choosing a Presidant and does not cause a lot of fights. Although I believe this some say that electoral voting is also safe and keeps people under control.

Some United states citizens, including me, believe popular votes are more fair and are more of peoples choices. Lots of citizens believe that with electoral votes it's not fair because with electoral votes candidates don't spend time in all the states, some states don't even see campaign ads. Also it's fair because that means that lots of people truly want that candidate for Presidant. Just like when Al Gore won the popular votes, which mean more poeple like him and thought he would be a great President, lost the whole campaign cause of electoral votes. Citizens also get more say if it were for just popular votes and with elctoral votes not so much because even if their is a tie people don't choose, House of Representatives do.

As for others they are completly against popular votes and think that electoral votes are more safe and calming for many reasons. It keeps it fair because it isn't based off which candidate put more comersuals out there or who people know more. With electoral voting you are voting for the electors in The Electoral College who then vote themsevles and are then are counted by Congress. Also with electoral votes not lots of arguing could happen. With popular votes people may begin to argue about who deserved it more cause more peple knew him rather than the other candidate. ""Also it more fair because each state has their own group of electors so they know who is better for their state."" (source 1, paragraph 5)

The essay successfully follows the instructions by addressing the topic of whether the Electoral College works, presenting arguments for and against it, and providing evidence from multiple sources to support the claim. However, the essay could be improved in several areas:

* The structure could be clearer, with more clearly defined paragraphs and a more logical flow between ideas.
* The essay lacks a strong thesis statement that ties all of the arguments together effectively.
* There are some spelling and grammar errors that detract from the clarity of the writing.
* The evidence presented is somewhat repetitive and could be strengthened by additional examples or sources to support each argument.
* The counterclaim about electoral voting being safer is not adequately addressed, and could be expanded upon to show why this argument is not valid.

17032,5028749,3,"This day more and more people are trying to limet car usage. Some people are use to not using cars, is a way of living. Other's are trying to stop car pollution and limet the usage of them. Cars cause alot of smog wich then goes into the air and pollutes it. This is very bad, especially for our health. Were the one that breathe this air in and if its polluted we may become sick. It is also a good stress releiver since you dont have to be stuck in trafic or having to hear the car honk all day.

In source 1 ""German Suburb, Life goes on Without Cars"" it talk abou how the people in Vauban, Germany do not use cars. Cars are allowed but people chose too not use them. 70 percent of Vauban's families to not own a car and some have even sold there to move there. Heidrum Walter said that when she had a car she was always tense and is more happier know that she dosen't own one. Vauban may be the most city in low-car suburban other part of the world are taking this as an example and trying it out to. More and more places around the world are making stores more near by or on a main street, rather than having them in a shopping center with a highway distant.

Parin,France is the city that has the most smog out of all cities in Europe. This means that the pollution rate is higher. Thats why acording to source 2 ,Paris enforeced a partial driving ban to help clear the air in the city. Citizens were ordered to leave there vehicles at home or pay a fine of $31. But this did not stop people from using cars almost 4,000 drivers were fined after this ban was enforced. The reason Paris had for doing this is because after five days of intensive smog the congestion was down by 60 percent. By enforcing this ban Paris was able to clear out the smog in 3 days and be back to normal on Tuesday.

I know that people may not want to give up using there cars, yes is an easier way to travel and get places faster. There right, but it would be better for the world and ourself if we could reduce the usage of cars not just in our cities but all over the world. Just how in Bogoa, Columbia they have car free days. People who live there have a car free day wich mean they biked, walked or took buses to all of the destenations they had that day. Bogota had been doing this for three consecutive years and the goal is to promote alternativ etransportation and reduce smog. Some people who live there say that by doing these they relieved stress. By Bogota doing this they have parks and sports centers, uneven sidewalks have been taking away and replaced with smooth sidewalks.

In the United States more and more people are buying less cars and fewer people get there licens as the years go by. Even though americans are know for ther big love on carr ,that seems to be reducing. This is very beneficial for carbon emmissions and the environment. People like Mimi Sheller a sociology professor at Drexel University researched different resources and said that the Internet makes telecommuting possible and we don't have to drive to a friend house to see them or talk to themm we can just use technology to do that. Also the percentage of people getting there license has chaged. People are finding ways to either walk, take public transportatio, or have somone cal-pool them ,rather than diving a car themselfs.

Introduction:
The article ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus"" presents a compelling case for why studying Venus, despite its harsh conditions, is a worthy pursuit. In this essay, we will evaluate the author's argument, focusing on the evidence provided to support the idea that Venus can be explored by humans and is worth investigating.

Body:
The author's claim that Venus is survivable for humans is supported by several pieces of evidence from the article. Firstly, while temperatures on the surface average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than Earth's (Paragraph 3), the author notes that conditions become more tolerable at an altitude of 30 miles above the ground. At this height, temperatures are approximately 170 degrees Fahrenheit, and air pressure is close to sea level on Earth (Paragraph 5).

Secondly, the article points out that solar power would be plentiful in Venus's upper atmosphere, and radiation levels would not exceed those found on Earth. These conditions suggest that with appropriate technology, humans could potentially survive and operate on Venus, given their ability to adapt to extreme environments (Paragraph 5).

Conclusion:
While living on Venus may be undesirable due to its intense heat and lack of activities, the author effectively demonstrates that it can be explored by humans. The evidence presented in the article shows that, with proper technology and safety measures, astronauts could survive and investigate Venus's unique environment. Therefore, I agree with the author's assertion that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite its dangers. This is especially true given the potential insights that exploring Venus can provide about our own planet and the possibilities of life beyond Earth.

Driverless Cars: A Risk Worth Taking? (Revised) 
My position on driverless cars is unwavering; I believe they are not worth the risk, especially considering my reservations about trusting technology with human lives and safety concerns that arise from potential technical failures. The following essay aims to argue against their development while incorporating details as mentioned in an article titled “Driverless Cars are Coming.”

Introduction: 
The world stands at the brink of witnessing one of its most significant technological advancements - driverless cars, which promise increased safety and efficiency. However, before embracing this futuristic concept wholeheartedly, it is crucial to evaluate potential risks associated with their development and operation thoroughly.

Body: 
As stated in the aforementioned article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” driverless cars come equipped with numerous benefits like reducing accidents caused by human error, optimizing traffic flow through efficient routing systems leading ultimately to decreased fuel consumption - points I do agree upon but these advantages should not be considered without weighing the risks they pose.

Firstly and most importantly, safety concerns cannot be ignored when discussing driverless cars' development on public roads sharing space with humans operating traditional vehicles; crashes involving children or unexpected situations could lead to disastrous consequences if computers are trusted solely for handling them without human intervention- a scenario I find terrifying. Imagine my child, running across the street and suddenly appearing before an autonomous vehicle that cannot break due to technical issues - such thoughts instill fear in me rather than comfort or assurance about their safety on our roads with driverless cars becoming mainstream technology:

Moreover, hacking remains a significant threat. As cyber-attacks become increasingly sophisticated and frequent worldwide (source needed), the potential for someone to exploit these vulnerabilities in autonomous vehicles is terrifying – turning everyday commuting into an unsafe journey without human control over life or death decisions:

Last but not least, I argue that embracing driverless cars means sacrificing essential values like mindfulness and appreciation of the world around us - speedy transport may come at the cost of neglecting our surr01965ng relationship with nature and each other as we're in constant rush to reach destination faster, forgetting what it truly means:

Conclusion: 
In conclusion, while driverless cars hold potential benefits for society if properly developed - I firmly believe they are not worth the risks associated; trusting technology over human life and safety concerns outweigh their perceived advantages. As we continue to make strides in technological advancements – our priority should always remain ensuring public wellbeing, mindfulness on roads as drivers or passengers alike - embracing driverless cars could ultimately lead us into a future where technology overpowers humanity rather than co-existing with it. Therefore, I stand firmly against the development of these autonomous vehicles – holding onto simpler ways to enhance our transport system that prioritize safety and mindfulness while enjoying life's journey together on shared roads; preserving what makes us inherently humane in this fast-paced world filled with technological wonders.",13.632448196411133,"30

16477,5074884,3,"""Pedestrian, bicycle, private cars, commercial and public transportation traffic are woven into a connected network to save time, conserve resources, lower emissions and improve safety."" Owning a vehicle helps get people from one place to another faster then just walking but some people really don't understand that there are advantages to not owning a vehicle. In the excerpts ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"", ""The end of car culture"" both by Elizbath Rosenthal and ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer, all explain how limiting car usage can help lower emission and conserve resources.

In the excerpt ""In German Suburb, life goes on without cars"" by Elizabeth Rosenthal explains why limiting car usuage would help lower emissions. For example, ""Passenger cars are responsible for 12 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in Europe...and up to 50 percent in some car-intensive areas in the United States. Cars are polluting the eniviroment that we all live in and are destroying the atomosphere because of all these greenhouse gases swirling through the air because of the use of cars. Furthermore, referring to another excerpt ""The end of car culture"" from Elizabeth Rosenthal also, proves why limiting car usuage will lower emission rates. For instance, ""What most intrigues me is that rates of car ownership per household and per person started to come down to two to three years before the turndown...it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviroment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants."" As you can see owning a car can be a advantage to your personal life but the enviroment is suffering because of the fumes from the vehicles everyone own but if less people start to walk more, ride bikes or even hike the enviroment wouldn't be suffering from so many emissions.

Likewise, in the excerpt ""Paris bans driving due to smog"" by Robert Duffer highlights how limiting car usage can help conserve resources. For example, ""After days of near-record polution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city...[The smog] rivaled Beijing, China, which is known as one of the most polluted cities in the world...Cold night and warm days caused the layer of air to trap car emissions."" Going back to what Rosental was pointing out emissions are still triggering the atmosphere. But, that is not the only thing that is being blamed for pollution. ""Diesel fuel was blamed, since France has...[a] tax policy that favors diesel over gasoline. Diesels make up 67 percent of vehicles in France, compared to a 53.3 percent average of diesel engines in Western Europe, accoring to Reuters."" Without any gasoline nobody will be traveling from one place to another so to conserve resources people are better off limiting the usage of their cars.

In conclusion, using cars less would help to lower emissions and conserve resources such as in this case gasoline. If everyone keeps driving aroud in cars the air is going to be full of Greenhouse gases and eventually resources to run cars will soon run out. Then without a car to take people where they need to go people will have no choice but to walk, ride a bike, or take public transportaton because everything id worn and ran out. This is why limiting car usage is a advantage for fellow citizens because it helps lower emissions and conserves resources.

10725,AAAOPP13416000039582,6,"Driverless cars aren't really driverless and may even cause more problems on the road. One negative aspect is that eventually the ability to drive a car would wither away and die. For example, if you took a one year old baby and cooked for and fed him until he was eighteen, would he be able to cook? Even if he watched you cook, he can never cook how you cook because he was never taught the skill. It wasn't needed. So just like that, manual driving can be eradicated for generations to come. Eventually, would anyone know how to drive?

Driverless cars are a thing of the future, but are they really better for us? Not necessarily. Although, there are just as many good things as there are bad. If a driver is exhausted and wanted to relax after a long day at work, then the driverless car can drive him home and into his bed. But maybe driving the car was the only thing keeping him awake and alert. There are solutions to this problem, the article states, ""They can steer, accelerate, and brake themselves, but all are designed to notify the driver when the road ahead requires human skills, such as navigating through work zones and around accidents."" But does this eradicate any threats or problems of driving driveless cars? But they aren't all bad. There are just as many positive characteristics then there are negative. But I believe that many issues will arise in the future.

Of course, they aren't completely driverless, but I strongly believe that driverless cars are more trouble than they are worth. Well that's a lie, because they're actually worth a lot. This introduces my next topic, inflation, of sorts. Even if all of the good overcomes the bad, the money value would increase exponentially. You think cars are expensive now? With all of the new technology and saftey features the car is now 5 times more than its original price. Not to mention if something needs to be replaced, how long will it take to make the part? What are the repercussions of ""fixed"" car parts? How expensive is one car part going to cost? Maybe even more than the car itself.

Furthermore, if the driverless car does get into a wreck, who is at fault? The article also states that new laws will be enabled due to liability coverage. If the technology failed, or just malfunctioned, would it be the manufactor's fault, or the drivers? Moreover, this opens up multiple scam oppertunities. Car companies have been known to scam people for their wealth, this is cutting edge ""scam material."" Car companies can rig a car to make it seem like it's perfect, and make it malfunction later to blame the driver. This can cause the problems between multiple car companies and their consumers.

These are some of the more minor issues. Mechanical products are not perfect, they have equally as many flaws as humans do. This can result in the loss of lives, the initial poverty increase, and even the simple result of losing the ability to manually drive a car. These are minor problems to car companies, but to one individual, it can cause many, many problems. But there are good things about these smart cars as well.

Retrogress back to paragraph two when I stated, ""There are just as many postive characteristics as there are negative."" I reiterate, there are more bad things than good, but there are some very good aspects. Such as, being able to drive safely and do other stuff that wasn't appropriate while driving such as watching your kid, doing some paperwork, and even able to send a text message without endangering others around them. These are only some aspects, what about the ability to make traffic run exponentially fast and safe. That is a positive aspect for all. But previous problems have arisen and they are the ""hallmark"" for inefficient driverless cars.

Nonetheless, I believe that driverless cars are not as reliable as many might think. I also believe that the thought of leisure while driving somewhere is a spontaneous oppertunity. These aspects may change life as we know it. Add them all up and it's clear to see that these ""smart cars"" aren't so smart after all.","In the article “Driverless Cars are Coming,” the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

The advent of driverless cars, a futuristic concept once relegated to science fiction, has become an imminent reality with significant advancements in technology and robotics. As these autonomous vehicles start taking the roads more frequently, it's crucial to evaluate both their potential benefits and drawbacks critically before embracing them wholesale into our daily lives.

Body: 
The enthusiasm surrounding driverless cars often overshadows several inherent challenges that these self-driving vehicles may pose on the road, including safety concerns due to software glitches and unpredictable human responses when faced with a machine in control of their vehicle (Article Reference). The fears regarding erasure of driving skills among future generations are also significant. A study reveals that if people spend years relying solely on autonomous systems, the ability for manual driving may become obsolete and be forgotten over time (""Driverless Cars Are Coming"").

Moreover, driverless cars pose a threat to job security as professional drivers might find their roles redundant. This concern extends beyond transportation services like taxis or trucks; it also includes delivery vehicles that play an integral part in our everyday lives (Article Reference). 

The inflated costs of these high-tech marvels are another considerable issue, which can make cars unaffordable for a vast number of people. Additionally, the reliance on specialized parts due to advanced systems means repairs and maintenance could become more complicated or even unfeasible in some cases (Article Reference).

Finally, determining liability is another critical aspect that needs careful thought as these cars continue evolving into their autonomous form. The article states potential legal loopholes with manufacturers' faults versus drivers', which could create new areas for lawsuits and insurance disputes (Article Reference).

Conclusion: 
While driverless cars offer undeniable conveniences, such as reducing the stress of driving in congested or unfamiliar settings, they also bring about several concerns that demand our attention. As we evaluate their role within society today and well into tomorrow's transportation landscape—it becomes evident that for these vehicles to truly flourish while keeping societal harmony intact, comprehensive regulation addressing liability issues along with thorough testing of safety protocols is imperative (Article Reference).

The response meets the prompt in some ways, as it presents an argument for a position on driverless cars and includes relevant details from the article to support that position. However, it lacks structure and cohesion, which makes it difficult to follow. The essay could benefit from clearer organization, stronger connections between ideas, and more concise and focused arguments.

8388,AAAOPP13416000100462,4,"Luke was had just graduated High School and had 2 part time jobs. One day Don, Luke's friend came to ask Luke if he wanted to travel on a cattle boat to Europe. Luke knew this was a once in a life time opportunity. Luke had said yes and at that moment he had just began an amazing adventure.

Luke had a very good experience that might have inspired the reader to do the same things. Luke was not only traveling in a boat to Europe but, he was also helping people get back to good shape because, world war 2 had just ended leaving them in bad shape. Students should be inspired because, Luke was helping people get back in good shape. People might also convinced to do the same thing Luke did.

Luke was having a lot of fun traveling around the world on a cattle ship. Luke knew this was an amazing opportunity in his life. Lukke himself had said that this was an amazing opportunity for a small town boy. He saw so many amazing things in the places he went. Luke had mentioned that he had been to Europe, China and Greece.

As Luke was on that cattle ship, he was helping people around the world get back to good shape, he was helping society. He was also bonding with animals, he was taking good care of animals. Most importantly it seemed like Luke was learning about the world and animals on this experience. Luke was experiencing how hard work felt. Luke, was really busy as they were crossing the Atlantic Ocean. He had to care of the animals by, feeding them, also giving them water and cleaning their stalls.

On his 2nd trip though he did have a diffcult time because, on a rainy night Luke was put as a watchman. He was supposed to check on the animals every hour. He had slipped down the ladder and got hurt. Because he couldn't work for a while, Luke found some ways to have fun on the ship. He and his friends played baseball and volleyball where the animals had stayed. After Luke had been discharged in 1947, Luke had made 9 trips(the most out of all seagoing cowboys!)

Luke knew from the very beginning that this travel was the very beginning of an amazing adventure. Luke had learned alot over his travel. He had been to so many amazing places.He had been part of an amazing adventure to help people, that might have inspired\convinced to do the same thing.","You have just read the article, 'A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'

However, without evaluating it against a specific rubric or knowing the standards expected by this instructor, giving such numerical scores is arbitrary:

Introduction: ""Imagine transforming your ordinary life into an extraordinary voyage across continents while making a profound difference in people's lives—this was my reality as part of the Seagoing Cowboys program.""

Body Paragraph 1 - Reasons to Join and Personal Experience: As I had just finished high school with only two jobs, this unique opportunity arose from an unexpected encounter. After graduating, Don asked me if I wanted to travel on a cattle boat across the Atlantic Ocean—a journey that combined adventure while helping others recover after WW2's devastation. Joining was my ticket back in time and forward into new experiences as both challenges and life lessons unfolded alongside service work every day, from feeding animals to cleaning their stalls.

Body Paragraph 2 - Broadening Horizons: My travel granted me exposure I never knew existed—from Europe's captivating cultures in Greece to China’s bustling streets and serene landscapes of the cowboy states across America. It was not just about visiting unique places; it allowed for personal growth as well, bonding with various animals along my journey that became like family on this floating world full of life lessons learned amidst laughter and playtime during downtime activities such as baseball or volleyball games where the livestock were temporarily housed.

Body Paragraph 3 - The Impact: Beyond self-growth, what truly touched my heart was being able to contribute positively back home—from helping individuals regain their physical strength during rehabilitation centers in Europe and Asia after war impacts that still linger on today. This journey wasn’t just about me; it became a collective mission working with others who shared the same passion for service alongside traveling adventures together across seas stretched wide beneath our feet aboard this very special ship carrying us towards horizons unknown yet welcomed into one of life's most rewarding experiences.

Conclusion: So, if you yearn to embark on an unforgettable journey that offers a wealth of personal growth opportunities while making meaningful contributions back home—consider joining the Seagoing Cowboys program today!

2041,AAAVUP14319000055150,5,"Did you know that the planet Venus has a lot of Earth like similarities? Well in the story ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. The author supports this idea giving factual evidence one being,Venus is somewhat referred to as Earths ""twin"", Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions, and Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades.

First of all, Venus is somewhat referred to as Earth's ""twin"". In paragraph two the author explains one way of how Venus and Earth are the same. The author states "" Venus is the closest planet to Earth in terms of density and size,and occasionally the closest in distance too."" In this way the author is implying the physical features are similar. The author also states that "" Today, Venus still has some features that are analogous to Earth. Like Mountains, rocky sediment, and even valleys."" Even though Venus has the same physical features as Earth its not the same as the things we need in order to live.

In addition, Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions. In paragraph three the author gives a description of the conditions on Venus. The author states that "" A thick atmosphere of almost ninety-seven percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere."" This here states that if humans were to travel to Venus they would not be able to survive because Venus's atmosphere is different from Earth. Not only that but the author also states that "" On the planet's surface, tmeperatures average over eight-hundred degrees Farenheit."" With that being said these living conditions are to extreme for humans to encounter because the pressure is ninety times greater than what humans expeirence on our own planet.

Finally, Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades. In the text it says ""Such an enviornment would liquify an metals"" With this being said everybody know spaceships are made of metal and that is why no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. The text also states that "" Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation of being a challenging planet for humans to study,despite its proximity to us."" In the end scientists are working to find better ways to advance in their technology and spacecraft to be able to continue their journey on Venus.

In conclusion the author suggests that studying Venus is worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Because Venus is somewhat referred to as Earths ""twin"", Venus has a dangerous climate and dosen't have the resources needed for our living conditions, and Not a single spaceship has been to Venus in more than three decades.

The argument is well-constructed and supported by specific details from the text which highlight both similarities to Earth that make it intriguing, but also emphasize why exploration remains challenging due to Venus's extreme conditions.

Claim: Although there are significant dangers associated with studying Venus as outlined in ""The Challenge of Exploring Venus,"" the author effectively supports their point by providing factual evidence about its Earth-like physical features, hostile climate, and exploration history—all aspects that present unique research opportunities despite inherent risks.

Explanation: The essay details how some parts of Venus are similar to Earth's geology (mountains, rocky sediment, valleys), suggesting valuable comparative study while also acknowledging the harsh environment with extreme temperatures and a thick atmosphere consisting largely of carbon dioxide. Despite these challenges, no spacecraft has survived on Venus longer than three decades due to its corrosive clouds—demonstrating just how tough conditions are for exploration but not deterring the author's argument regarding worthiness in pursuit.

Introduction: The essay begins by introducing Venus as Earth’s ""twin,"" a planet that has similar physical features and one which, despite its challenges, is deemed worthy of study—a claim supported throughout with factual evidence from the article discussed below (essay provided).  
Body: In this part of my essay assessment I break down how well the author supports their thesis. The body explains that Venus has Earth-like features and also describes its harsh environment, including high temperatures and corrosive clouds making survival difficult for humans or spacecraft (evidence from article). Despite these challenges, scientists continue to research advancements in technology—showing resilience towards the pursuit of studying Venus. 
Conclusion: The essay wraps up by reinforcing that despite its dangers and extreme conditions, exploring Venus is a worthy endeavor due to potential learning opportunities about our own planet and solar system's evolution (concluding evidence from article). This final emphasizes the author’senquiry into studying Venus while acknowledging existing difficulties in doing so.

Rating justification: I am rating this essay as an 85 because it effectively communicates its main points about why exploring Venus is worthwhile despite dangers but does occasionally veer off topic with unnecessary detail and repetition, which could have been eliminated for a stronger conclusion (hence not giving the full score of 100).",11.307973146438599,"70

This essay does a good job of addressing the question and providing evidence to support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. The introduction sets up the argument and the body provides three pieces of supporting evidence: (1) Venus's similarity to Earth in terms of size and density, (2) Venus's dangerous climate and uninhabitable living conditions for humans, and (3) the lack of recent exploration of Venus due to its hostile environment. The conclusion effectively summarizes the argument and reiterates the author's purpose for exploring Venus despite its dangers.

However, there are some areas for improvement:

* Sentence structure and grammar could be improved in places. For example, ""Well in the story 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus,'"" can be simplified to ""In 'The Challenge of Exploring Venus,'""
* There is a repetition of the phrase ""despite its dangers"" throughout the essay which could be replaced with synonyms or rephrased for variety.
* The author could have provided more specific examples of how studying Venus could benefit humanity, rather than just emphasizing its similarity to Earth. This would further support the claim that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit.
* The essay could also include information about the current efforts being made by scientists and space agencies to overcome the challenges of exploring Venus and make it a more viable destination for future exploration.",9.091453790664673

17097,5027802,4,"Limiting car usage can put a new perspective in your life. Limiting car usage can be a huge benefit because first of all, you'll have better health. This even goes out to the healthiest people in this world. Secondly, Global Warming will be less harsh and dangerous to all the living creeatures of the world. Lastly, you can be more open and associate with many people. Limiting car usage is probably the best idea to reduce all the hazards and bad things on Earth.

To begin with, I want to inform you that car usage has become worse and worse over the years. Our health is in jeopardy because of how much we use cars. But with limiting car usage around the globe anyone can become a healthier person. A great percent of our population in th United States are overweight or obese. Even all over the globe! With limiting how much time we use cars we can reduce that percent and become healthier people because that way we can walk to our places and not just sit down in a car doing absolutely nothing. People have become much happier in limmiting their car usage. Those people go out and get fresh air and not sit in a car going from place to place. And with being much happier has come less stress. People who are too stressed are not to happy that's why its better not using a car just to go grocery shopping. You wouldn't have to worry about the lights and stop signs or be scared if your going to be in a car accident. The only time you should be able to use a car is going long distances and places like other cities.

To move foward, Global Warming has become a really big issue for us. All the pollution that Planet Earth gets from cars is absurd! Cars release so much gas and harmful substances that we breathe in. It doesnt only affect us but animal too and all living things. Now the smog has gotten way worse. Paris has a huge percent of smog covering the city that even France has enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the city. Congestion has gone down to 60 percent. Beijing, China is known as one of the most polluted city in the world. Now everywhere you go even if its really cold nights arent as cold as they used to be. Cold nights and warm days have caused the warmer layer of air to trap car emissions.

Another thing about limiting car usage is that you can even associate with other people around you. Just walking to you local market or a food restaurant you are probably say hello to different people some even communicating with them. You can walk to parks or go walk to a nearest pool or beach and I gaurantee you that you're going to be talking to many different people throughtout the day. You can use alternative transportation such as bus, bikes, scooters and let me tell you being in bikes and scooters is a lot more fun a relaxing then driving a car or being in one. Walking and hiking around is a huge relieve of stress.

Hence, limiting car usage is a big improvement for us it will help us in so many ways. Such as, we can improve our health and we could be so much better because a great percent of this world is either overweight or obese and limiting cars can help you go out and walk or even bikes can get you where you want to go and thats a form of exercise. Global Warming has been on the rise. It's been rising and rising and limiting how much we use cars can absolutley help with it by lowering the pollution the temperatures may not be so hot you wont feel like your boiling just walking outside your front door. You can associate with many different people throughout your day even if it's just a simple hello. Walking to grocery stores and restaurants can make you feel a whole lot better and relieve your stress and also communicate with other people. We all need to put a limit in everything good or bad, so lets start doing it now!    ",Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

The essay successfully identifies several benefits of limiting car usage, such as improved health outcomes due to increased walking or cycling (evidenced by reduced obesity rates), mitigated global warming impacts through lower emissions leading to better air quality and less extreme temperatures, and enhanced social interactions while on foot. However, the essay would benefit from directly linking these points back to a car-free city scenario as per the prompt name which was not done explicitly. Additionally, there is limited discussion of potential challenges or drawbacks that could be expected in transitioning towards more pedestrian and non-motorized transportation use within urban settings.

Lastly, integrating personal stories or case studies from existing car-free cities would strengthen its argument as it provides concrete evidence of living with fewer cars within urban settings; this approach is missing in the essay provided.

The writer provides a clear thesis statement and maintains focus throughout the essay, discussing three main points: improved health, reduced global warming, and increased social interactions. The response also demonstrates an understanding of the prompt's requirement to use evidence from multiple sources, mentioning examples such as Paris and Beijing.

The only potential issue is that the response could benefit from additional supporting details to reinforce its arguments. For example, when discussing health benefits, it would be helpful to include specific statistics or studies that support the claim that limiting car usage can lead to better overall health for individuals. Similarly, when discussing global warming, providing more concrete evidence of how cars contribute to pollution and smog could strengthen the argument.

Overall, the response is well-written and effectively addresses the prompt's requirements, earning a high grade.",6.128238916397095

This idea has swept across the country and everyone has there own idea on it. It has everyone thinking if its the right thing to be on the road or not. It helps people out alot but then it may back fire and not be the best choice for them. Everyone has their own opinion on this world wide idea.

There are lot of positive aspects to it. For instance helping the disabled people get around. Instead of asking for a ride and making things harder. They can have a diverless car. Also for people who are tired or sick that may fall asleep or get destracted at the wheel. This can prevent accidents and dealths from accuring. There are also sensors on the car that alert people when a accident may occur so that the driver can take control. These sensors are all over the car, and are in places that the driver can not see. Like in the drivers blind spot of course and where they are not able to see car, people, and other objects. It also helps with accident close near, and traffic jams too. Not to mention you can relax about having to go the right speed limit and about trying to multie task while driving. It is a great asset to the future.

However the car is not garunteed to be completely safe, and for you to not pay attention to the road and other around you still. There are some negatives to the car. For instance the car could still get in accidents. Something in the car may still go wrong and you may not know it. Then if you get in the accident the person in the driver seat is held responsible for it all. Also it is not legal in some states still. So you can't just drive it wherever you feel like. Another con about the car is it may not know where to go. If you want to stop through a fast food, how would the car know how long to stop for? Same for picking up precriptions at the pharmacy, or just meeting people and getting out of the car to talk. Is there a timer or what? What happens if you want to go somewhere else while you are on the way to the first place? Does this mean you have to pull over to a safe location and type all the information in?Many people question these things because if something were to happen it would come back on them.

The primary issues are safety, legality, navigation challenges in real-life situations, reliance leading to laziness, and potential liability for owners involved in incidents regardless of their driving role during such events.

Safety is my main concern as the author admits that driverless cars can still be faulty or fail unexpectedly (20/100). This implies an unpredictable risk factor which I believe outweighs benefits, especially since human error accounts for most road accidents and technology isn't foolproof. Moreover, although some sensors might alert about possible collisions, they may not always work effectively in different weather or light conditions (15/100).

Legally speaking, the author notes that driverless cars aren’t fully legalized yet across states which poses potential hurdles and confusion to their users. This inconsistency could lead owners into unanticipated troubles if laws change unexpectedly or they inadvertently break current regulations (10/100).

Furthermore, I am concerned about the navigation issues that driverless cars face - like how long a car should stop at fast-food drive-thrus and pharmacies without knowing when to start driving again. These uncertainties could lead drivers into unnecessary inconvenience or possible delays (5/100).

Lastly, my position is shaped by the potential risk of dependency on driverless cars leading individuals towards laziness in their role as observant and attentive operators behind wheels. Although this point might not directly relate to safety issues discussed earlier, fostering such behavior could ultimately result negatively affecting road user's skills (5/100).

In conclusion, while recognizing the potential benefits of driverless cars from a technological standpoint and for certain individuals with mobility constraints or illnesses that may hamper driving ability. My stance leans against their development on broader societal levels due to safety concerns, legal issues, unresolved navigation problems in real-world scenarios, as well as potential risks of complacency among drivers relying too heavily on autonomous technology (25/100).

Title: A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves - An Enriching Experience Beyond Boundaries
Introduction: Luke Bomberger, a recent graduate with jobs at both his local grocery store and bank, was presented with the opportunity to join an extraordinary adventure in Europe. This invitation came from one of his friends who proposed going on a cattle boat trip as part of their Seagoing Cowboys program - something Luke couldn't resist due to its rarity being 'an opportuity of a lifetime.'
Body: Joining the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity gave him reasons beyond just seeing new sights. It was an expedition that allowed Luke and Don to work hands on with horses, young cows, and mules - vital duties for maintaining animal welfare during their voyage across seas (Luke's previous experiences at his aunt’s farm played into this). This aspect of the journey imparted invaluable practical skills. Luke discovered more than just thrilling adventures on board as he enjoyed time to relax and unwind, particularly after uploading animals back home - something that turned him from an ordinary cowboy into an extraordinary seagoer (Luke's perspective). Notably, the essence of 'A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves'' journey went beyond just adventures. Luke found it opened up new world horizons and perspectives for himself which he acknowledged as something profoundly gratifying: ""I am grateful for this opportunity.""
Conclusion: In conclusion, joining the Seagoing Cowboys program was not only a thrilling voyage but also an enriching experience that provided Luke with unique skills on board animals and broadened his world view. The 'A Cowboy Who Rode The Waves'' journey is definitely more than just adventure - it's transformative, learning-filled experiences beyond the ordinary cowboy life – something worth every bit of anticipation for any aspiring seagoer like Luke Bomberger (Luke’s perspective).",9.921392679214478,"40

14440,5265267,4,"Car use all over the world has tried to be reduced throughout the years in attempt to save the environment by using fewer green house emissions, air pollution, and smog. Participating in these measures can help. If all countries would participate, this could make a huge revolution for the world and the environment.

In Vauban, Germany the roads are almost completely car free. There are a few exceptions, but they come with a cost. Exceptions according to Rosenthal's source 1, paragraph 2 include, ""Car ownership is allowed, but there are only two places to park-- large garages at the edge of the development, where a car-owner buys a space, for $40,000, along with a home."" This action  allows people to purchase a vehicle, but reduces the amount of people buying them because of the exorbitant additional cost for a parking garage and having to buy a house in that area too. As stated in paragraph 3, of source 1, it has resulted in ""70% of Vauban's families do not own cars and 57% percent sold a car to move here."" Also sated in  paragraph 3, source 1, the people who had cars in the past were always stressed, but now without cars their stress levels have gone down, and they are much happier. Positively, in response to the people eliminating most of the car use, Vaunban has built stores and malls that are in walking distance of the people,  (paragraph  6, source 1).

In Paris, smog levels have been at their all-time high. In response to these problems, Paris has come up with a system that still allows driving, but reduces the amount of drivers. Their system, according to paragraph 2, of source 2,  is ""On Monday motorisrs with even-numbered license plates were ordered to leave their cars at home or suffer a 22-euro fine ($31). The same would apply to odd-numbered plates the following day."" This would not only reduce smog, but also traffic jams, rush hours, and congestion by 60% says source 2, paragraph 5. This leaves Paris with a win-win. Less traffic leading to less stress, and less smog resulting in a healthier city.

Bogota, Columbia participated in a car free day too. As a result, like many others, it reduced pollution and stress. It caused a happier, healthier environment. People who didn't participate were fined $25. If you offer a punishment, it will allow people to participate because they don't want to be fined.

Also, offering other forms of transportation such as a bus, bycicles, or skating propel people to do it because they know there will be other forms of ways to get to where they need to go. Negatively, people need to be at a certain place, on a certain time, resulting in their rebellion to take place in the activities held in the city.

Positively, the large amount of participation has resulted in the growth of parks, sportcenters, malls, and reconstruction of sidewalks to promote fewer car uses, says source 3, paragraph 9.

Elisabeth Rosenthal really touches on the reduction of greenhouse gas emmision because it is better for the environment and for the health of the people world-wide. If technology continues to advance, like it has in the past years, people can continue to communicate over the phone and use car pulling to reduce the amount of cars driven daily.

Sharing cars or reducing the amount we get to use them, will also supplement safety for people by reducing car crashes which could save many lives.

2922,AAAVUP14319000019810,5,"The idea of Venus being worth of pursuit, depsite its dangers, isn't completely outrageous. The author of this passage dives into this idea, stating a reason as to why Venus exploration should happen, and also stating reasons that it currently isn't possible. Though the author does touch on the ideas of why we should explore this planet, they do not give enough reason to support the claim, or at least enough reason and ideas to keep the idea circulating within the brain of all of the readers.

The author seems to use at least two of their paragraphs to give why we should travel to Venus, in a sense that we were able to do so. In Paragraph 3 they describe the conditions of the planet, adding that Venus has volcanoes, earthquakes, and lightning strikes just as Earth does. This is just the start of the author's biggest and only claim, which fully arrives in Paragraph 4. The author does so by adding more physcial features of Venus and almost putting them side by side to Earth's. ""Long ago, Venus was probably covered largely with oceans and could have supported various forms of life..."", and adding that ""...Venus still has some features that are analogous to those on Earth."" Later on, they also state that Venus has recognizable features, such as valleys, mountains, and craters. The author wrote only about how scientists would learn the history of Venus, and gave no reasoning beyond this.

Though displaying a solid claim, the author gives no further explaination to their only reasoning, and goes straight into talking about the difficulty of traveling to the planet. There are multiple things the author could have slipped into the passage, like the abundance of information that scientists would learn, opening further travel, and the creation of new technology. Scientists and man alike would obtain much needed information from exploring Venus. Not only would going to this planet tell us its history, just as the author said, but it would push us closer to the exploration of planets that sit beyond this.

The author described a trip to Venus as being one that would be no fun for humans, but if able to create technology to keep our explorers safe, there would be smaller and fewer limits on the places our explorers and scientists could go after. By picking such a harsh planet to start one of many trips, the work and energy put into a way to reach the planet would pay off more than the world seems to understand. Though the technology used to get to Venus would have to be updated depending on the length of travel and the conditions of travel,--snowy and colder climates or hot, tretorous terrain like Venus--it is quite possible to get more out of Venus than what is displayed.

Readers do receive great information from this passage, but the author could have been equipt to know more reasons as to why studying Venus would be a great thing for scientists. They did give the wonderous and plentyful reasons as to why it will be harsh to reach and remain on the planet, however. Despite this all, Venus is a planet to reconcile with, even if it means waiting the months or years it takes to make just the technology compatable enough to work with its body.

Evidence from the article supporting my claim includes the limited focus on how scientists could learn about Venus' history by observing Earth analogs like valleys, mountains, and craters; however, this section lacks substantial evidence or detailed explanation of what those discoveries might entail for our understanding of planetary science.
The introduction begins with an acknowledgment that studying Venus is worthwhile despite its dangers but quickly shifts focus to the difficulty rather than exploring why such a study could be valuable beyond immediate obstacles, thus missing out on setting up a strong foundation in support of this claim right from the start. The body then touches upon physical features and historical potential for life without delving deeply into these areas or suggesting how they directly benefit scientific understanding over Earth's own geological past - an essential aspect that could have bolstered Venus exploration arguments if expanded upon adequately. Lastly, in the conclusion, while acknowledging possible technological progress to withstand harsh conditions on Venus is mentioned, it doesn’t effectively tie back into a persuasive argument or summary of benefits from studying this planet - an opportunity missed for reinforcing why such risks are worth taking.

In this paragrpah i am going to talk about the challenges author states in the story about venus,

NASA's asspects on venus and how we can deal with these problems. Some challenges the author says that venus is thowing at us is that venus has a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide that is covering the planet. In paragraph the the author also states that venus is on average 800 degrees Fahrenheit, that is hotter than mars and mars is the closest planet to the sun. The author also states that the atmosherpic pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on earth. If the earth had that muh atmospheric pressure than there would be no one left on this planet because that is so much pressure that it can crush a submarine. Beyond high pressure and heat, Venusian geology and weather present additional impediments like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes to probes to land on its surface. Next, i am going to talk about how NASA asspects on venus. Some thing that NASA is saying is that there only possible solution for how hot it is and how much pressure is in the air is that with these hostile conditions that venus shoudl allow scientists to float above the fray. Imagine a blimp-like vehicle hovering 30 miles above the rolling Venusain landspace, with that venus would avoid the unfriendly group conditions by staying up and out of the way. The temperatures over the ground would still be 170 degrees fahrenheit, but the pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. These conditons are not easy, but thye are surviable for human's. Finnally i am gonna talk about how we can solve the high pressure and high temperature. The first way we can solve these conditions are if we started having people go and live on venus and took some other living organisms with them. The second way we could solve it is if we found away to connect venus to earth and that would take away all ot the problems.

Many countries around the world have an abundance of car buyers and users, however others are taking into consideration alternatives. The advantages of limiting car usage include relief from stress of cars upon individuals and reduced emissions in the environment.

Cars put forth a lot of stressful trouble upon users. These vehicles are designed to transport a person or people from point A to point B, however cars are for personal use that can cost an immense amount of money. ""When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,"" said Heidrun Walter about her new ""car-free"" lifestyle (Rosenthal,3). This ideaology is spreading throughout all Europe as more alternate transportations are provided by the government. As Selsky mentioned in Source 3, locations, such as parks and sports centers with uneven sidewalks, have been replaced with broad, smooth ones for citizen's use. Moreover, many cities have provided a bicycle program to promote less usage of cars. These steps towards change help convince people that there are alternatives out there, and that we aren't limited to just buying a car and license to go to places.

Additionally, the limitation of car usage help establish a better and healthier environment for everyone. Cars emulate lots of dangerous gases that may harm our precious earth, many of which are responsible for the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect causes gases to be trapped in the atmosphere which harms our ozone layer and creates a smog-like appearance on our cities. Paris is an example of a polluted city as civilians battle against threatening smog from emissions of diesel cars in France (Duffer,8). Many actions towards progressive behavior have increased the likelihood of limited car usage, such as tolls throughout cities and fines up to $25 for violators of laws. These enforcements will ensure that the environment is capable of maintaining generation after generation at a stable pace.

To conclude, many countries are pondering choices of opportunites to promote less usage of cars, while some are on their way to solve these issues, limitations on car usage have a variety of advantages for ourselves and the environment.
