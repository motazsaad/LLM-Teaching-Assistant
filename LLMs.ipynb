Yet, we have explored Mars much more than we have Venus. Venus has left us mind-boggled on how to study it with it's dangerous conditions, such as the thick acid rain, the average temperature of over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure that is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet. Though the exploation is worth these risks for we can explore a planet that scienctists believe could have been once similar our own. Nasa has developed many ideas and solutions to hopefully find new ways to study one of the closest planets to us.\\n\\nThe first way that NASA has created to help us observe Venus is a blimp-like plane to fly over Venus. This idea of the vehicle is stated in paragraph 5, \\\"Just as our jet airplanes travel at a higher altitude to fly over many storms, a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly gorund conditions by staying up and out of their way.\\\" Also later on in this paragraph where it states, \\\"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be plentiful, and radiation would not exceed Earth levels.\\\" Now these conditions would most defintely be harsh, but would be capable of living through, escpecially astronauts who are/would be trained for these conditions. This would at least give us an above look of Venus and be able to study some of it's physical features.\\n\\nThe problem that NASA would now have is figuring out a way to study up close and on the surface of Venus. They have a solution for this issue as well in the form of old World War 2 computers, the solution to this problem is explained in paragraph 7 as it says,\\\"Another project is looking back to an old technology called mechanical computers...\\\" Also further on in the paragraph it reads,\\\" The thought of computers existing in those days may sound shocking, but these devices make calculations by using gears and levers and do not require electronics at all. Modern computers are enormously powerful, flexible, and quick, but tend to be more delicate when it comes to extreme physical conditions.\\\" And even later in paragraph seven it states, \\\"By comparsion, systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat and other forces.\\\" These older computers would be able to be dropped down onto the surface of Venus and take samples of the terrain and it's geological features allowing NASA and it's scientists to study the information gather and create better models to study more of Venus and understand the planet.\\n\\nAnother way NASA is thinking to study Venus on it's surface is simple electronics, the ideas and princples of these machines are stated in the beginning of paragraph where it states, \\\"For example, some simplified electronics made of silicon carbide have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface and have lasted for three weeks in such conditions.\\\" The simplified electronics would be used the same way as the mechancial computers, in which to study the terrain of Venus and collect data from Venus and to send it back to NASA allowing them to study the data.\\n\\nVenus is a very interesting planet with many disadvantages and conflicts like the difficulty of being able to study the planet's terrain or even to be able to observe the planet in a hover-like state from above. If the challenges that NASA faces can be solved with solutions stated above, then Venus could be a very worhty pursuit, so that we may discover the secrets of one of the closest planets to us. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"assignment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"In \\\"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\\\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The author mentioned that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet . His solution to survive this weather that is dangerous to us humans is to allow them to float above the fray. A \"blimp-like\" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions . At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. So not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans. So this would help make the mission capeable of completing.\\n\\nHe also mentions how peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penertrate the dense atmosphere making it hard to take photographs . They also cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. So many reaserchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to help gain some imformation of Venus.\\n\\nThey are working on other ways to study Venus such as simplified electrnics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface .

From earth people can see Venus from a safe distance. The Earth has a planet that is closer to it and it´s called Venus. Earth and Veus are often referred as twins. Venus has blanets of thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide. The more challengeinng about Venus´s atmosphere is that it has highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Venus has a average temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it´s pressure is 90 times greater in the atospheric. Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian additional impediments weather like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. If Venus is so inhospitable, why the scientists are discussing further visit to the surface. Astronomers thinks that Venus was probably covered with largely oceans and could have supported various forms of life ,just like Earth. Venus surface has rocky sediment and familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus surface at thirty-plus miles, its temperature would be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit. but its air pressure would be close to match the Earth´s sea level. The Earth´s solor power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on its level. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, form a distance. Therefore, scientists are seeking to start a conduct mission to understand Venus. By the system comparison that used machanical part can be made more likey resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

The Electoral College contains of the selection of the electors and there is a meeting of electors to vote for President and Vice President. The popular vote shows what citizens want, lets people have the freedom to choose who they want to be president, and have a better result.\\n\\nFirst of all, the popular vote shows what citizens want. It tells the government what they are doing right or wrong. For example, if people say they want a democracy, that tells them that they want the right to speak for themselves. They want the freedom of speech that they deserve.\\n\\nFurthermore, the opportunity to let people make a decision of who should be president for their country. For example, when people were voting for Obama or Romney, Obama had the most popular votes. That shows that the citizens trusted Obama in representing our country. They liked what his plans were going to be and trying to help us with our problems.\\n\\nLastly, it provides an accurate result of who should be president. It gives the percentage of how many people actually voted for the person that is going to be elected for president. For example, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and 51.3 percent of popular vote. The votes show that people wanted Obama to be president instead of Romney because people like Obama's future plans.\\n\\nIn summation, instead of having an Electoral College, it should an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Popular votes helps the government understand their citizens better. It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them.

Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.\\n\\nTo begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"(source 2). This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.\\n\\nIn addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. \"rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic;\"(source 3).\\n\\nFurthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. \"When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" (source 1) says a citizen of a \"car-free\" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.\\n\\nHence, limiting car usage will create a better enviroment for people all around the world.</td>\n","      <td>Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

Many of them produce pollution that is not healthy for anyone, and by anyone meaning humans, plants and animals. In life there are disadvantages and advantages for everything but limiting car usage has more advantages. If people limit the car usage there would be less pollution and people will be less stressed.\\n\\nTo begin, too much pollution can be very bad for the world. If people start limiting their car usage then the air we breathe will be much fresher and cleaner. Also more plants will grow and more of everything will survive.\\n\\nFurthermore, people all around the world will be less stressed. While driving a car people have to deal with everyone getting infront them and skipping lines or dealing with traffic, well if they start limiting car usage then that problem will me resolved. There would be less cars in the streets and everything would flow more. The lines to go pick up their children at school will reduce. Everything would go smoother and more fluently.\\n\\nTo conclude, it is obviously more comfortable driving a car than a bike or a motorcycle, but people have to understand that limiting it would make things a lot better. Less people would be stressed because they will not have to deal with others cutting in lines, and another very important detail, less accidents will occur due to that less cars will be around then the usual.</td>\n","      <td>Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.\\n\\nTo start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.\\n\\nBesides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, \"If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.\" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.\\n\\nNow with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.\\n\\nThe results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.</td>\n","      <td>Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

The author mentioned that on the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet . His solution to survive this weather that is dangerous to us humans is to allow them to float above the fray. A \"blimp-like\" vehicle hovering 30 or so miles would help avoid the unfriendly ground conditions . At thirty-plus miles above the surface, temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees Fahrenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. So not easy conditions, but survivable enough for humans. So this would help make the mission capeable of completing.\\n\\nHe also mentions how peering at venus from a ship orbiting or hovering safely far above the planet can provide only limited insight on ground conditions because most forms of light cannot penertrate the dense atmosphere making it hard to take photographs . They also cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, from a distance. So many reaserchers are working on innovations that would allow their machines to last long enough to help gain some imformation of Venus.\\n\\nThey are working on other ways to study Venus such as simplified electrnics made of silicon carbide that have been tested in a chamber simulating the chaos of Venus's surface . So far they have lasted for 3 weeks in these conditions which is more than enough time hopefully for them to be able to grab enough information. Their other project that they are working on is using an old technology called mechanical computers. They are powerful, flexible, and quick. Systems that use mechanical parts can be made more resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.\\n\\nHe feels that studying Venus even though its dangerous is valuable because of the insight they could gain about the planet itself but also becuase \"human curiosity will likely lead us into many equally intimidating endeavors.\"\\n\\nI think the author supported his claim very well he explained why he thought it as nessary to go even though it is dangerous and he gave solutions to some of the dangers on Venus such as sollution to the heat and ways to actually help gain evicence and imformation on Venus.

In paragraph 1 it says \"Venus, sometimes called the \"Evening Star ,\" is one of the brightest points of light in the night sky. \" which is one of the couple of things that make Venus a worthy pursit like it's said. Another thing that is interesting is that Venus is the closest planet to Earth in density and in size also in distance. Also no spacecraft has survied to land for more than a couple of hours in more than three decades. One of the few things that make Venus a dangerous planet is that it's the hottest surface temperature of any planet in our solar system as said in paragraph 3. Also \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. \" the planet's surface temperature average is over 800 degrees. The planet has a surface of rocky sediment and it includes familiar features such as valley and mountains. In paragraph 7 it states that NASA is working on other approaches to studying Venus and they're making simplified electonics to test more of Venus's surface but the devices that are being made only last about 3 weeks because of the heat and the conditons of the surface.

The author aslo listed the dangers about venus, he aslo compairs the thing that would happen in venus to thing that can be shown with a exampel on earth. Here is one of his exampel \" just imagine a cell phone or tablet to acid or heat capble of melting tin.\" Thats showes the venus is really hot. NASA has one particularly compelling idea for sending humans to study nenus, venus world allow the scientists to float abover the fray \" imaging a blimp-like vehicl hovering 30 or so miles abovethe roiling vensian landsacape\". that shows that its would be risky but it should not stop us from studing venus.

From earth people can see Venus from a safe distance. The Earth has a planet that is closer to it and it´s called Venus. Earth and Veus are often referred as twins. Venus has blanets of thick atmosphere of 97 percent carbon dioxide. The more challengeinng about Venus´s atmosphere is that it has highly corrosive sulfuric acid. Venus has a average temperatures over 800 degrees Fahrenheit and it´s pressure is 90 times greater in the atospheric. Venus is the hottest surface temperature of any planet even thought Mercury is closer to our sun. Venusian additional impediments weather like erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. If Venus is so inhospitable, why the scientists are discussing further visit to the surface. Astronomers thinks that Venus was probably covered with largely oceans and could have supported various forms of life ,just like Earth. Venus surface has rocky sediment and familiar features suck as valleys, mountains, and craters. Venus surface at thirty-plus miles, its temperature would be toasty at around 170 degress Fahrenheit. but its air pressure would be close to match the Earth´s sea level. The Earth´s solor power would be plentiful and radiation would not exceed on its level. More importantly, researchers cannot take samples of rock, gas, or anything else, form a distance. Therefore, scientists are seeking to start a conduct mission to understand Venus. By the system comparison that used machanical part can be made more likey resistant to pressure, heat, and other forces.

Congress should change the election by popular vote for the president of the Unites States. The Electoral College contains of the selection of the electors and there is a meeting of electors to vote for President and Vice President. The popular vote shows what citizens want, lets people have the freedom to choose who they want to be president, and have a better result.\\n\\nFirst of all, the popular vote shows what citizens want. It tells the government what they are doing right or wrong. For example, if people say they want a democracy, that tells them that they want the right to speak for themselves. They want the freedom of speech that they deserve.\\n\\nFurthermore, the opportunity to let people make a decision of who should be president for their country. For example, when people were voting for Obama or Romney, Obama had the most popular votes. That shows that the citizens trusted Obama in representing our country. They liked what his plans were going to be and trying to help us with our problems.\\n\\nLastly, it provides an accurate result of who should be president. It gives the percentage of how many people actually voted for the person that is going to be elected for president. For example, Obama had 61.7 percent of the electoral vote and 51.3 percent of popular vote. The votes show that people wanted Obama to be president instead of Romney because people like Obama's future plans.\\n\\nIn summation, instead of having an Electoral College, it should an election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. Popular votes helps the government understand their citizens better. It lets them know what people want from the government, allows them to have the freedom to make a choice of the president, and gives the government a picture of how many people liked a candidate's plan for them. All in all, popular votes would make elections for the president a lot better to understand.                       Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

Slowly, the advantages are beginning to outweigh the disadvantages. Around the world, projects and programs have been started to test the effects of limited car use. Data has proved that limiting car usage will cause less pollution, less stress, and less traffic.\\n\\nTo begin with, gas released from our cars has slowly started to hurt us. \"After days of near-record pollution, Paris enforced a partial driving ban to clear the air of the global city.\"(source 2). This shows that the gas in our cars is one of the factors responsible for the growing pollution in our air. Reducing the usage of cars will not only benefit us, but also the world we live in.\\n\\nIn addition, almost everyone knows what it is like to be stuck in traffic. The stress inducing event must not be healthy either. By declining the use of cars, congestion will slowly diminish. Promoting other ways of transportation will improve health, mood, and traffic. \"rush-hour restrictions have dramtically cut traffic;\"(source 3).\\n\\nFurthermore, a large portion of our population are constantly stressed. Car usage is accountable for a good amount of it. \"When i had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" (source 1) says a citizen of a \"car-free\" community. By limiting car usage, healthier ways of transportation are encouraged. For example, hiking, biking, skating, and walking. All of these are extremely healthy compared to sitting in a car. Due to the fact that the United States is the country with the fattest people, these methods should be enforced. Healthy people then start to become happier. Therefore, reducing car usage will benefit our people's lives.\\n\\nHence, limiting car usage will create a better enviroment for people all around the world.

Many of them produce pollution that is not healthy for anyone, and by anyone meaning humans, plants and animals. In life there are disadvantages and advantages for everything but limiting car usage has more advantages. If people limit the car usage there would be less pollution and people will be less stressed.\\n\\nTo begin, too much pollution can be very bad for the world. If people start limiting their car usage then the air we breathe will be much fresher and cleaner. Also more plants will grow and more of everything will survive.\\n\\nFurthermore, people all around the world will be less stressed. While driving a car people have to deal with everyone getting infront them and skipping lines or dealing with traffic, well if they start limiting car usage then that problem will me resolved. There would be less cars in the streets and everything would flow more. The lines to go pick up their children at school will reduce. Everything would go smoother and more fluently.\\n\\nTo conclude, it is obviously more comfortable driving a car than a bike or a motorcycle, but people have to understand that limiting it would make things a lot better. Less people would be stressed because they will not have to deal with others cutting in lines, and another very important detail, less accidents will occur due to that less cars will be around then the usual.                                                                                            Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage. Your essay must be based on ideas and information that can be found in the passage set.

Car and truck transportation is one of the leading causes in air polution. Ruducing the use of cars will be beneficial to the public, not only on the streets, but to the citizens themselves.\\n\\nTo start off, the reduction of cars on the streets will cause less stress to the people who drive them. For example, in Source 1 it shows how a woman is happier and the loss of her car has changed her life for the better. \"When I had a car I was always tense. I'm much happier this way,\" she says. The tension of being in a car and waiting in traffic can be stressful and cause people to get impatient, grumpy, and even irritated. The woman proves that her life has changed because she doesn't have to go through that anymore. Her car-less life is the one that makes her happy.\\n\\nBesides that, not only does car reduction cause better mood for people, but it also lessens the air pollution and makes the enviornment cleaner and better for people to live in. According to Source 4, \"If the pattern persists- and many sociologists believe it will- it will have beneficial implications for carbon emissions and the enviornment, since transportation is the second largest source of America's emissions, just behind power plants.\" This proves that when cars are being used less, there is also less carbon emission into the air and that is helpful to the enviornment. This benefits and makes the air cleaner and safer to breathe.\\n\\nNow with every thing good, there is always a bad. In source 2 it is explained how the delivery companies were complaining of lost revenue. Yes, this will be a problem with the delivery companies, but there are other ways of transporting goods to their destination such as by train, boat etc. Also in Source 2 there were arrangements made for the the cars to go out on certain days, so the delivery companies' problems were not all that bad. The reduction of cars benefits the public more than it what it hurts.\\n\\nThe results of limiting car usage has been greatly proven through studies done (in source 4) and it is believed that it should continue to be limited and or reinforced. The people are happier, the enviornment is safer and the air is clean. There is more help than there is hinder and soon it will be seen throughout the world that cars are better in the garage.                                                                                                               Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

It uses technology to give data as to what emotions someone is feeling such as happiness, sadness, and boredom. These technologies are possibly going to be used in classrooms to help students learn better based on their emotions towards the lesson that they are learning. However, the use of software to determine the emotional expressions of students in the classroom is not valuable to the students learning experience.\\n\\nTo start, in order for this new technology to work, students woukld have to constantly be watched by cameras that read their expressions. This is said in the text when it says, \\\"Using imagery, the new emotion-recognition software tracks these facial movements,\\\" (D'Alto 4). One can see from this that the students would always have to be watched and their facial movements would all be recorded. This could be an issue of privacy for some students if they do not want to constantly be recorded. It also makes it easy for outside threats to hack this system and watch students or get personal information from the videos. Emotion-recognition software can also be expensive for schools, especially since it doesnt work on normal PC computers. The text states, \\\" Your home PC can't handle the complex algorithms used to decode Mona Lisa's smile,\\\" (D'Alto 7). This shows that normal computers that students would typically use cannot support this technology, making the school buy the technology that can support it. This would be a costly job and if the school cannot pay for it then the students would have to and some families may not be able to afford it. Lastly, students facial expressions may not directly correlate with the emotion they are feeling towards the lesson that they are learning. This can be seen in the text when it says, \\\" A classroom computer could recognize when a stuent is becoming confused or bored,\\\" Dr Huang predicts. \\\"Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human instructor,\\\"\\\" (D'Alto 6). This exemplifies that the schools want to use this technology to help students learn more effectively by using technology thats like a teacher. For some students this may cause trouble if they make facial expressions, but it's not about the lesson. Such as if a student is told something by another student and the student looks confused, the computer might see that and think they dont understand the lesson. Then it would modify the lesson for the student even if the student understood it just fine. A teacher would be much better at understanding the students emotions in a certain situation than technology.\\n\\nStudents need to be able to learn on their own and to communicate with teachers on how well they\\u00b4re understanding what they\\u00b4re learning. By using facial recognition technology, its taking away their communication skills. There are many flaws to the facial-expression technology that make it a bad candidate to use in schools. It\\u00b4s certain that there are plenty of good uses for facial expression technology, however using it in schools is not one of them.          \",\n          \"When you need advice who do you go to? Do you go to your mom, dad, family, friend or do you got to more than one? Most people when they need advice they ask more than one person. When they do it helps get more opinions, makes then think about what they are doing and helps decide what to do.\\n\\nGetting more than one opinion\\u00a0is very helpful. Someone may say something and the other another may say something way different. It shows different things to do in situations. With more than one opinion it shows the pros and cons about what your asking. Asking a lot\\u00a0of people for advice it very helpful so you can get more ideas and choices about what your going to do.\\n\\nIt also makes you think. Lets say you need to choice what career you wanted to do and you wanted to be either a nurse or a doctor. One person may say you should be a doctor because you will earn more money but another may say the opposite. They may say to become a nurse because later if you wanted to become a doctor you could go back to school and become a doctor. With those opinion it makes you think about the importance of what your going to do.\\n\\nLastly it helps you decide what to do in situations. Since you person can say one someone else another. Lets take the career choice example since one person said to become a doctor and the other a nurse. With those opinion it helps you decide what to do. You could become a nurse then see if you like the job or if not then you could go back to school and get your education to become a doctor.\\n\\nWhen asking for advice it is helpful to ask more than one person. Getting more than one opinion, thinking about it, and what to do are very helpful when you ask for advice from people. It makes things easier if you get more advice. The more people you ask the better because it will open up to choices you have may not realized existed.\",\n          \"This passage is talking about cars an how it's polluted.

Some certain areas in the United States ban phones from class rooms just because of it.\\n\\nWhen people have phones, they know about certain apps that they have .Apps like Facebook Twitter Instagram and Snapchat. So like if a friend moves away and you want to be in contact you can still be in contact by posting videos or text messages. People always have different ways how to communicate with a phone. Phones have changed due to our generation.\\n\\nDriving is one of the way how to get around. People always be on their phones while doing it. Which can cause serious Problems. That's why there's a thing that's called no texting while driving. That's a really important thing to remember. Some people still do it because they think It's stupid.

Using a phone while driving can cause very bad wrecks, because they are putting themselves and other people at risk. People should not be able to use cell phones while operating a vehicle is because bad wrecks, putting others' lives in danger, and may cause death.\\n\\nFirst of all, wrecks can be caused by looking down at your phone while driving. Most importantly, you should always keep your eyes directly on the road when behind the wheel of a car. On that note, you will have an outrageously car payment just because you were looking down at your phone. Moreover, if you the reason the accident happened the person that was operating the other car can sue you for lots of money, and you will have to pay it. Therefore, if you don't pay whatever the person charges you consequences will be served and that's behind bars.\\n\\nAnother reason why we should not be able to use cell phones while operating an automobile is that you are putting other people's lives in danger. Thus, looking down at your cell phone you can get someone else hurt for the uncommunicative act you committed. As well as unconsciousness, injuries, or being in a hospital.\\n\\nThe main key to not texting and driving while behind the wheel of a car. Mainly, it can cause tragic, terrifying, and horrific things to you and to others and that's death. That's the most important thing to not using electronic devices while operating a vehicle. With the intension, of you not keeping your eyes and staying focus on the road you can easily turn off the road or hit another victim. Possibly another humankind could go away of all flesh because of your stupidity.\\n\\nMust be remembered, always stay focus on the road so you can get to your destination safely. So, you can't cause accidents, put other people lives in danger, and possibly death. Important to realize, do not use your phone while operating a vehicle. At least, wait till you make a safe stop or until you arrive at your destination.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>432</td>\n","      <td>Phones and driving</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>179</td>\n","      <td>Phones and driving</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.\\n\\nAccording to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.\\n\\nAccording to another article, \"Distracted Driving\" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not able to work a vehicle while using their cell phone.

This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.\\n\\nWithin a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.\\n\\nConversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.\\n\\nThe creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>334</td>\n","      <td>Phones and driving</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

Studies have shown the average Americans faring far better in their lives compared to their counterparts because they are listening to other's advice. There are also many myths that have the moral of listening to other people's opinions. For example, Perseus got his achievement of slaying a gorgon because he listened to the Oracle. Another example I have is the fable of Osiris, in which Osiris listens to Sekhmet and becomes the king of he underworld. In all of these stories, the hero listens to other people, and benefited from the people around them being more knowledgeable, more experienced, and giving the hero more choices to consider. Therefore, I believe listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice because they have more experience compared to you, know the pros and cons of your choice, and gives you multiple perspectives to deliberate over.\\n\\nFor example, let us talk about the anecdote of little Generic_Name, whose life was changed forever by listening to a person who has more experience than him. As a young lad, little Generic_Name always dreamed of becoming a soldier, because he admired his mother who fought in WW2. But Generic_Name's mother, who lived through the inhospitable battlefield, didnt want her child to follow her path. As a result, she talked to him about the hardships that plagued her when she was a soldier, and successfully changed his mind. Thanks to Generic_Name's mother changing little Generic_Name's mind, He became a successful and joyous doctor who saves countless of lives every day. If Generic_Name's mother hadn't been a soldier who has lived through the darkest depths of hell called the battlefield, then she wouldn't have been able to change little Generic_Name's mind, and he may have had his life cut short. Another story we can talk about is the story of little Generic_Name, who always wanted to be a magician. Generic_Name always fantasizes about being on stage, listening to the crowds wild applause as she entertains them, and thankfully, her father is there to fulfill her fantasies. Thanks to Generic_Name's father being a renowned magician, he had the connections and knew the tricks that could excite the crowd. As a result, Generic_Name became the greatest magician of that generation. If Generic_Name's father wasnt a magician who had walked the path Generic_Name was planning to walk, then she wouldnt have been able to reach the heights she was reaching right now. Therefore, I believe that listening to people who have more experiences compared to you an help you make a better judgment.\\n\\nAnother anecdote we can talk about is the anecdote of Generic_Name, a menacing ancient man who knew the pros and cons of doing drugs. As Generic_Name was walking the streets of New Jersey, he saw a group about to eat drugs. Generic_Name walked towards the group, and he latched his hand on to the nearest person's, and stopped the person from doing some drugs. Generic_Name reprimanded the group about doing drugs, and thanks to his menacing presence, the group stopped downing some pills. Thanks to the effort of Generic_Name who lectured the group about the pros and cons of eating drugs, the group was saved from the evil influences of drugs, and grew up to be a group who fought against drug use. If Generic_Name wasn't telling the group about the pros and cons of drugs, they would have eaten it and fallen into a path which is very hard to recover from. But thankfully, Generic_Name saved them from that despairing future. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted o be doctor. Generic_Name didn't know much about being a doctor, except that she wanted to be one, so her grandfather talked with her about her choice. As they discussed the pros and cons of being a doctor, Generic_Name grew more knowledgeable about the choice she is going to make. As a result, Generic_Name is much more firm in her beliefs about being a doctor, and grew up to be an amazing doctor. If she didnt' talk with her grandfather about her choice, she would have made an uniformed decision that likely would have ruined her life. Therefore, I believe that listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice by giving them the pros and cons of their choice.\\n\\nOne anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted to be a lawyer because her friend's advised her. She was steadfast in her beliefs as she always enjoyed rules and regulations, until her mother gave her a new perspective to mull over. She told her to aim to become a supreme dragon, rather than being a struggling python.\\n\\nAs a result, Generic_Name aimed to be a supreme judge, and she became one at the age of 65. Thanks to her mother giving her better advice, She became a star that outshone other's in the world of law. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name whose life changed thanks to a fateful encounter that changed his life. Generic_Name felt forced to be a fashion designer, as it was a family tradition.\\n\\nHe didn't know what to do, until he heard his grandmother talking with his family about animal cloning. He grew interested in animal cloning and researched it until he considered it a his future career. As a result, he grew up to become a biologist, doing something he loves. If it wasn't for his grandmother telling Generic_Name's family members about animal cloning, he wouldn't have even considered it, and may have grown to be a nihilistic person who isn't able to change his fate of suffering. Therefore, I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can give them multiple perspectives to consider.\\n\\nIn conclusion, little Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and many more changed their entire lives by listening to other people. If they didn't seek other's advice, they would have fallen into a path that would not allow their potential to bloom. But, thankfully, they chose to listen to other people. As a result, they grew to be figures that were respected around the world. Therefore, I in believe seeking multiple opinions.</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>1050</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Advice is an opinion,that's told to another person. I think advises help people make better choices. Some reasons I think why advises helps is keeps you safe, makes goal come true, and makes changes.\\n\\nThe reason I think advises help is keeps you safe. There are many dangerous people and thing in the world. That could hurt you in so many ways. When I got invited to a sixteen and up birthday party. I was so ready to go but i didnt know if i should go to the party. So i asked my mom for advice. Then she told me it wouldn't be the best idea,I could get kidnapped. I agreed with her and didn't go. That advice from my mom saved me from getting kidnapped.\\n\\nAnother reason I think Advises help is make goals come true. Getting to your goal is pretty hard. But if you have someone to push you through it you can do it. When I gave up on becoming an Artist. My friend told me some advice telling I need to keep going until i reached my goal. And said she cheering for me. I felt hopeful again and happy that she there for me.\\n\\nThe last reason I think advises help is makes changes. Words are powerful and so are action. They can make things happen with multiple of them. At our school,the lunches are very unhealthy. We tell our teacher but they didn't listen. So we interview people around the school and asked them to sign a paper. Once we were done. We when over to the school board. And told them about the unhealthy lunches at schools. They agreed that schools should change their lunches to healthier lunches. And changed the lunches served a schools.\\n\\nAdvises can be helpful or not helpful. But if it can help you then please listen to it. Don't block it out .So many people think it's useless. But it help in so many like keep you safe,make goals come true or makes changes. You can't do everything on your. Sometime it's better to ask for help.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>373</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Or, when you were studying for a math test, did you ever ask your parents or sibling about different ways to tackle a certain problem? Asking for other's opinions is especially beneficial as it allows for an individual to receive a variety of different views towards a given topic. Likewise, being diverse and asking many people for their opinions allows one to understand how most people percieve something. This is especially important as knowing multiple opinions can allow someone to take those views into account and sway themseleves to the general audience. Knowing different people's opinion can be beneficial in a variety of situations.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, a great example about how knowing other's opinions is helpful is when someone is making the choice between smoking or refraining from smoking. A student can watch on a TV channel that smoking is bad, and can damage their internal organs. However, on another channel, the student can find advertisements about the most addicting smoking device that can release the most dopomine in the brain, all the while not severly harming people's lungs. This student will receive a variety of different views and opinions on a certain topic, which allows them to make the best educated choice or decision based on how they interpret what they saw. Similarily, a student can be told from his fellow classmates that smoking is fun, joyful, and makes them happy. However, if the student asks a local doctor, they will be informed differently. A doctor will most likely tell them that smoking, although seeming harmless at first, can lead to serious long term consequences.\\n\\nIf the student asks both his friends and his doctors, he is able to use his judgemental skills to determing which choice will be best for him in the long run.\\n\\nFurthermore, asking for multiple opinions can benifit during competitions for a position slot, as cadidates needs to make decisions on what they need to say or do. For example, it can be helpful in situations like elections, both for the U.S. or simply in school. If a student is running for a position in office to represent his/her school, he/she can ask a widespread and diverse audience. First, asking other students is their best bet to obtaining information. Other students can inform him/her about what they want, like better water fountains, recess, or healthier food. Then, the student running can make changes to the way they run for the election, and on his/her speech, take a different approach. In addition, if the student running asks an adult, they will get to know a more realistic way the school can be improved. Since a student, even as a student officer, isn't able to make a significant change to a school, they can inform the school board about ways to make the school better. If someone is running for the president of the United States, a similar approach can be taken. First, they can ask the people, on social media or in speeches, about positive ways to reform our country. After the candidate receives the opinion of general audiences, they can campaign differently to match the view of those voting. All in all, asking for the opinion of multiple different people can set the candidate apart from others.\\n\\nMany people only ask one type of audience for their opinion. Having only one opinion can lead to negative consequences, such as making the wrong choices related to health or education, as only one audience is adressed into making a decision. Therefore, asking multiple different people who have different backgrounds is essential to making the best choices in life. Conclusively, knowing multiple opinions on a certain matter can evidently lead to better results for individuals.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>631</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

People often ask for advice when they can not decide on one thing. It's always good to ask others for their advice when making a choice. When you have multiple opinions you have the ability to make the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice because it can decrease stress levels, a great chance to learn something new, can be very helpful and beneficial.\\n\\nTo begin with, Seeking information from more than one person can decrease stress levels. When making a decision there is a chance that you can become very stressed and overwhelmed. Being stressed can cause a person to give up on what they are doing. Having multiple opinions from people can make choosing an option less difficult and more easier. The information that you receive from others may have a special meaning in the future. Other peoples opinion can make a person feel confident in making the right choice.\\n\\nWhen you ask other people for their opinion you can also learn many new things. Everyone is different and may have more experience than you. Seeking other peoples opinion can cause you to gain a new skill or lesson. For example, someones advice could teach you how to do something the correct way. Many people are very different and have experience different things in life. Seeking advice from others can teach you a lot. We all learn from our mistakes in life, by sharing your past experiences you may prevent someone else from making the same mistake.\\n\\nSeeking others opinion can be very helpful and beneficial. Taking other peoples advice and doing what they say may lead to a great outcome. When you receive other opinions whether they are good or bad you will be able to look at them from a different point of view. For example, When a group of people give you advice on yourself, you then know how they look at you as a person. Everyone looks at certain things from a different prospective. How someone else looks at it may be how its supposed to be viewed in life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, You can learn from others experiences by seeking the advice that someone give you. Making decisions can cause stress on a person. Relating to someones advice may higher your self-esteem because you no longer feel left out. Ask others for advice when making a difficult decision. When you seek others opinion more opportunities are available fro yourself.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>417</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Interviews are a perfect example of seeking more than one opinion. Interviews are seen on the news, in professional sports, and other places as well. There are a lot of people that can help you buy the right product as well. They can all open you up to new ideas. I think talking to more than one person on an opinion is a better choice because it shows you more than one option, it can change your perspective of a topic, and it informs you about what other people enjoy.\\n\\nFirst, I think it shows you more than one option. One opinion of a person might destroy your choice on an option rather than opening it up. The whole point of asking what is the better choice, is to make it better, not worse. You could already have the better opinion, and that person might ruin it, but more people would give you a good balance of what you need to know. Multiple opinions can stride you toward different answers. Different answers will most of the time make things go in the right direction. Its good to show variety in what you're going to pick in order to get the best choice. One opinion could be someone who isn't informed on the idea. They might not know anything about the topic and might just state a random answer. That can really throw you off if you don't get more ideas than just that one person. That can have the same effect as what I said before. That one person could mess it all up for you. All of the people you ask shows you more than what you thought was the best choice.\\n\\nNext, it can change your perspective on the topic. One person can change your option, but it may not lead you in the right direction. That direction could make you unhappy with your choice if you are comparing a product to see which one to get. You could take that one persons advice and follow it, but it might not be the best advice you could get. Multiple people have a better chance of leading you to the right opinion. When you get the opinion of multiple people, it balances out what might be the favorite option, or what might be the better option. A lot of times, changing your opinion is for the better. You could be looking at the wrong choice, and multiple opinions might lead you to the right path. It gives new ideas and ways to look at a situation and make the right choice. It can make you change your opinion.\\n\\nFinally, it informs you about what other people enjoy. Having more than one person's opinion might lead to an agreement with those people. You could be really stuck on a certain product you are trying to buy, and someone could save that entire situation by finding a good version of that product. You could also learn more about culture and peoples opinions in a certain area, or a certain time. Many people are different and sometimes that is based off of the environment around them, and where they grow up that could affect what a person likes. If you ask multiple people in the same area you grew up in, you should be leading yourself to the right choice. It can also lead to meeting new people, and making new friends. You could agree on an opinion and start a bond there. It all helps you on knowing not only what you like, but what a lot of other people like.\\n\\nIn conclusion, finding more than one persons view is better because it shows more than one opinion, it can change your own opinion, and it can inform you on what other people enjoy. If you are ever interviewing people, or looking for advice from other people to make the right decision, make sure you ask multiple people and not just one person for that advice! I always ask friends, family, or other people for help and advice if I should do something or not. You've probably asked multiple people for advice as well!</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>706</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

thoughtless. Especially new drivers, all driver for that matter do not understand the dangers of looking at a cell phone while behind the wheel.\\n\\nThe automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing, teens have been the largest age group that was reported to being distracted by cellular usage. I do not agree with people using their cell phones and driving, humans should be smarter to know that if something is going on while they are driving that is so important then pulling off to the side of the road. The society doesn't understand that teens are the main cause for accidents I mean, in two thousand and five there was three hundred and one thousand injuries that were caused in distracted driving related accidents, that doesn't necessarily mean that the driver was texting or using a cellular device. New drivers do not understand that deaths are usually results of an accident. one out of every four car accidents is caused by texting and driving.                        2         179         Phones and driving  Independent    Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

vehicle. Drivers who used their phone while operating a vehicle are most likely to get into an accident that could be fatal.\\n\\nAccording to an article by the Edgar Snyder Firm, 21% of teens that were part of a fatal car accident was due to phones. According to the same article, 35% know the risk but continue using their phones while on the road. This shows that its beyond dangerous and irresponsible of drivers not to be fully aware of their surroundings while driving. Drivers should be able to concentrate without any distractions, because it could be fatal.\\n\\nAccording to another article, \"Distracted Driving\" by the NHTSA, there has already been about 3,000 phone related car accident deaths since 2017. The article states that teen get too distracted with their phones, which causes their accident. Accidents that can be easily avoided by focusing on the road and not a phone. Drivers should not be able to use their phones at all while driving.\\n\\nIn conclusion, drivers should not able to work a vehicle while using their cell phone.

This system was found to be rather slow and new pathways were searched for until the invention of the telegram; the people thought it was an invention of the millennia, but after time it too was thought of as slow until the invention of the telephone. Today, a telephone is in the hand or pocket of a majority of the seven billion people on planet earth. However, this device is taken to areas that it is irresponsible and dangerous.\\n\\nWithin a vehicle capable of traveling upwards of one hundred miles per hour any possible distraction can become fatal spontaneously. The most common of these distractions is a cell phone, with its capabilities to connect us to anyone also in ownership of one, it is easy to pick it up whenever it sounds. In that split second of reaching over for a phone, eyes no longer on the road, it is impossible to no an exact location of anything, making an extremely dangerous action. For the myriad of possibilities that lead to serious injury cell phones should stay in the current state they are in regards of the law, but taken as a more serious offense.\\n\\nConversely people may believe that laws in present need to change, becoming less restrictive. People have the right to communicate with whom they wish, when or wherever they may choose to do so. The problem becomes apparent that this is a selfish process of thought; people aren't thinking of those they share the road with. Laws currently in place are not to punish people making poor choices, they are an attempt to keep people safe.\\n\\nThe creation of telecommunication devices was to keep connected to others without regard to the obsession that would encompass the human mind that was bound to follow. The safety of people is top priority without exemption.                           4         334         Phones and driving  Independent    Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

of Americans believe seeking multiple opinions can help them make better choices, and for good reason. Studies have shown the average Americans faring far better in their lives compared to their counterparts because they are listening to other's advice. There are also many myths that have the moral of listening to other people's opinions. For example, Perseus got his achievement of slaying a gorgon because he listened to the Oracle. Another example I have is the fable of Osiris, in which Osiris listens to Sekhmet and becomes the king of he underworld. In all of these stories, the hero listens to other people, and benefited from the people around them being more knowledgeable, more experienced, and giving the hero more choices to consider. Therefore, I believe listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice because they have more experience compared to you, know the pros and cons of your choice, and gives you multiple perspectives to deliberate over.\\n\\nFor example, let us talk about the anecdote of little Generic_Name, whose life was changed forever by listening to a person who has more experience than him. As a young lad, little Generic_Name always dreamed of becoming a soldier, because he admired his mother who fought in WW2. But Generic_Name's mother, who lived through the inhospitable battlefield, didnt want her child to follow her path. As a result, she talked to him about the hardships that plagued her when she was a soldier, and successfully changed his mind. Thanks to Generic_Name's mother changing little Generic_Name's mind, He became a successful and joyous doctor who saves countless of lives every day. If Generic_Name's mother hadn't been a soldier who has lived through the darkest depths of hell called the battlefield, then she wouldn't have been able to change little Generic_Name's mind, and he may have had his life cut short. Another story we can talk about is the story of little Generic_Name, who always wanted to be a magician. Generic_Name always fantasizes about being on stage, listening to the crowds wild applause as she entertains them, and thankfully, her father is there to fulfill her fantasies. Thanks to Generic_Name's father being a renowned magician, he had the connections and knew the tricks that could excite the crowd. As a result, Generic_Name became the greatest magician of that generation. If Generic_Name's father wasnt a magician who had walked the path Generic_Name was planning to walk, then she wouldnt have been able to reach the heights she was reaching right now. Therefore, I believe that listening to people who have more experiences compared to you an help you make a better judgment.\\n\\nAnother anecdote we can talk about is the anecdote of Generic_Name, a menacing ancient man who knew the pros and cons of doing drugs. As Generic_Name was walking the streets of New Jersey, he saw a group about to eat drugs. Generic_Name walked towards the group, and he latched his hand on to the nearest person's, and stopped the person from doing some drugs. Generic_Name reprimanded the group about doing drugs, and thanks to his menacing presence, the group stopped downing some pills. Thanks to the effort of Generic_Name who lectured the group about the pros and cons of eating drugs, the group was saved from the evil influences of drugs, and grew up to be a group who fought against drug use. If Generic_Name wasn't telling the group about the pros and cons of drugs, they would have eaten it and fallen into a path which is very hard to recover from. But thankfully, Generic_Name saved them from that despairing future. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted o be doctor. Generic_Name didn't know much about being a doctor, except that she wanted to be one, so her grandfather talked with her about her choice. As they discussed the pros and cons of being a doctor, Generic_Name grew more knowledgeable about the choice she is going to make. As a result, Generic_Name is much more firm in her beliefs about being a doctor, and grew up to be an amazing doctor. If she didnt' talk with her grandfather about her choice, she would have made an uniformed decision that likely would have ruined her life. Therefore, I believe that listening to other's advice can help someone make a better choice by giving them the pros and cons of their choice.\\n\\nOne anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name, who wanted to be a lawyer because her friend's advised her. She was steadfast in her beliefs as she always enjoyed rules and regulations, until her mother gave her a new perspective to mull over. She told her to aim to become a supreme dragon, rather than being a struggling python.\\n\\nAs a result, Generic_Name aimed to be a supreme judge, and she became one at the age of 65. Thanks to her mother giving her better advice, She became a star that outshone other's in the world of law. Another anecdote I want to talk about is the story of Generic_Name whose life changed thanks to a fateful encounter that changed his life. Generic_Name felt forced to be a fashion designer, as it was a family tradition.\\n\\nHe didn't know what to do, until he heard his grandmother talking with his family about animal cloning. He grew interested in animal cloning and researched it until he considered it a his future career. As a result, he grew up to become a biologist, doing something he loves. If it wasn't for his grandmother telling Generic_Name's family members about animal cloning, he wouldn't have even considered it, and may have grown to be a nihilistic person who isn't able to change his fate of suffering. Therefore, I believe seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because it can give them multiple perspectives to consider.\\n\\nIn conclusion, little Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and many more changed their entire lives by listening to other people. If they didn't seek other's advice, they would have fallen into a path that would not allow their potential to bloom. But, thankfully, they chose to listen to other people. As a result, they grew to be figures that were respected around the world.

Advice is an opinion,that's told to another person. I think advises help people make better choices. Some reasons I think why advises helps is keeps you safe, makes goal come true, and makes changes.\\n\\nThe reason I think advises help is keeps you safe. There are many dangerous people and thing in the world. That could hurt you in so many ways. When I got invited to a sixteen and up birthday party. I was so ready to go but i didnt know if i should go to the party. So i asked my mom for advice. Then she told me it wouldn't be the best idea,I could get kidnapped. I agreed with her and didn't go. That advice from my mom saved me from getting kidnapped.\\n\\nAnother reason I think Advises help is make goals come true. Getting to your goal is pretty hard. But if you have someone to push you through it you can do it. When I gave up on becoming an Artist. My friend told me some advice telling I need to keep going until i reached my goal. And said she cheering for me. I felt hopeful again and happy that she there for me.\\n\\nThe last reason I think advises help is makes changes. Words are powerful and so are action. They can make things happen with multiple of them. At our school,the lunches are very unhealthy. We tell our teacher but they didn't listen. So we interview people around the school and asked them to sign a paper. Once we were done. We when over to the school board. And told them about the unhealthy lunches at schools. They agreed that schools should change their lunches to healthier lunches. And changed the lunches served a schools.\\n\\nAdvises can be helpful or not helpful. But if it can help you then please listen to it. Don't block it out .So many people think it's useless. But it help in so many like keep you safe,make goals come true or makes changes. You can't do everything on your. Sometime it's better to ask for help.                                             4         373  Seeking multiple opinions  Independent  When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Or, when you were studying for a math test, did you ever ask your parents or sibling about different ways to tackle a certain problem? Asking for other's opinions is especially beneficial as it allows for an individual to receive a variety of different views towards a given topic. Likewise, being diverse and asking many people for their opinions allows one to understand how most people percieve something. This is especially important as knowing multiple opinions can allow someone to take those views into account and sway themseleves to the general audience. Knowing different people's opinion can be beneficial in a variety of situations.\\n\\nFirst and foremost, a great example about how knowing other's opinions is helpful is when someone is making the choice between smoking or refraining from smoking. A student can watch on a TV channel that smoking is bad, and can damage their internal organs. However, on another channel, the student can find advertisements about the most addicting smoking device that can release the most dopomine in the brain, all the while not severly harming people's lungs. This student will receive a variety of different views and opinions on a certain topic, which allows them to make the best educated choice or decision based on how they interpret what they saw. Similarily, a student can be told from his fellow classmates that smoking is fun, joyful, and makes them happy. However, if the student asks a local doctor, they will be informed differently. A doctor will most likely tell them that smoking, although seeming harmless at first, can lead to serious long term consequences.\\n\\nIf the student asks both his friends and his doctors, he is able to use his judgemental skills to determing which choice will be best for him in the long run.\\n\\nFurthermore, asking for multiple opinions can benifit during competitions for a position slot, as cadidates needs to make decisions on what they need to say or do. For example, it can be helpful in situations like elections, both for the U.S. or simply in school. If a student is running for a position in office to represent his/her school, he/she can ask a widespread and diverse audience. First, asking other students is their best bet to obtaining information. Other students can inform him/her about what they want, like better water fountains, recess, or healthier food. Then, the student running can make changes to the way they run for the election, and on his/her speech, take a different approach. In addition, if the student running asks an adult, they will get to know a more realistic way the school can be improved. Since a student, even as a student officer, isn't able to make a significant change to a school, they can inform the school board about ways to make the school better. If someone is running for the president of the United States, a similar approach can be taken. First, they can ask the people, on social media or in speeches, about positive ways to reform our country. After the candidate receives the opinion of general audiences, they can campaign differently to match the view of those voting. All in all, asking for the opinion of multiple different people can set the candidate apart from others.\\n\\nMany people only ask one type of audience for their opinion. Having only one opinion can lead to negative consequences, such as making the wrong choices related to health or education, as only one audience is adressed into making a decision. Therefore, asking multiple different people who have different backgrounds is essential to making the best choices in life. Conclusively, knowing multiple opinions on a certain matter can evidently lead to better results for individuals.                      4         631  Seeking multiple opinions  Independent  When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

People often ask for advice when they can not decide on one thing. It's always good to ask others for their advice when making a choice. When you have multiple opinions you have the ability to make the best choice for yourself. Seeking multiple opinions can help a person make a better choice because it can decrease stress levels, a great chance to learn something new, can be very helpful and beneficial.\\n\\nTo begin with, Seeking information from more than one person can decrease stress levels. When making a decision there is a chance that you can become very stressed and overwhelmed. Being stressed can cause a person to give up on what they are doing. Having multiple opinions from people can make choosing an option less difficult and more easier. The information that you receive from others may have a special meaning in the future. Other peoples opinion can make a person feel confident in making the right choice.\\n\\nWhen you ask other people for their opinion you can also learn many new things. Everyone is different and may have more experience than you. Seeking other peoples opinion can cause you to gain a new skill or lesson. For example, someones advice could teach you how to do something the correct way. Many people are very different and have experience different things in life. Seeking advice from others can teach you a lot. We all learn from our mistakes in life, by sharing your past experiences you may prevent someone else from making the same mistake.\\n\\nSeeking others opinion can be very helpful and beneficial. Taking other peoples advice and doing what they say may lead to a great outcome. When you receive other opinions whether they are good or bad you will be able to look at them from a different point of view. For example, When a group of people give you advice on yourself, you then know how they look at you as a person. Everyone looks at certain things from a different prospective. How someone else looks at it may be how its supposed to be viewed in life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, You can learn from others experiences by seeking the advice that someone give you. Making decisions can cause stress on a person. Relating to someones advice may higher your self-esteem because you no longer feel left out. Ask others for advice when making a difficult decision. When you seek others opinion more opportunities are available fro yourself.                      4         417  Seeking multiple opinions  Independent  When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Interviews are a perfect example of seeking more than one opinion. Interviews are seen on the news, in professional sports, and other places as well. There are a lot of people that can help you buy the right product as well. They can all open you up to new ideas. I think talking to more than one person on an opinion is a better choice because it shows you more than one option, it can change your perspective of a topic, and it informs you about what other people enjoy.\\n\\nFirst, I think it shows you more than one option. One opinion of a person might destroy your choice on an option rather than opening it up. The whole point of asking what is the better choice, is to make it better, not worse. You could already have the better opinion, and that person might ruin it, but more people would give you a good balance of what you need to know. Multiple opinions can stride you toward different answers. Different answers will most of the time make things go in the right direction. Its good to show variety in what you're going to pick in order to get the best choice. One opinion could be someone who isn't informed on the idea. They might not know anything about the topic and might just state a random answer. That can really throw you off if you don't get more ideas than just that one person. That can have the same effect as what I said before. That one person could mess it all up for you. All of the people you ask shows you more than what you thought was the best choice.\\n\\nNext, it can change your perspective on the topic. One person can change your option, but it may not lead you in the right direction. That direction could make you unhappy with your choice if you are comparing a product to see which one to get. You could take that one persons advice and follow it, but it might not be the best advice you could get. Multiple people have a better chance of leading you to the right opinion. When you get the opinion of multiple people, it balances out what might be the favorite option, or what might be the better option. A lot of times, changing your opinion is for the better. You could be looking at the wrong choice, and multiple opinions might lead you to the right path. It gives new ideas and ways to look at a situation and make the right choice. It can make you change your opinion.\\n\\nFinally, it informs you about what other people enjoy. Having more than one person's opinion might lead to an agreement with those people. You could be really stuck on a certain product you are trying to buy, and someone could save that entire situation by finding a good version of that product. You could also learn more about culture and peoples opinions in a certain area, or a certain time. Many people are different and sometimes that is based off of the environment around them, and where they grow up that could affect what a person likes. If you ask multiple people in the same area you grew up in, you should be leading yourself to the right choice. It can also lead to meeting new people, and making new friends. You could agree on an opinion and start a bond there. It all helps you on knowing not only what you like, but what a lot of other people like.\\n\\nIn conclusion, finding more than one persons view is better because it shows more than one opinion, it can change your own opinion, and it can inform you on what other people enjoy. If you are ever interviewing people, or looking for advice from other people to make the right decision, make sure you ask multiple people and not just one person for that advice! I always ask friends, family, or other people for help and advice if I should do something or not.

you ever been in a situation where you needed to make a decision that will affect you for the rest of your life? Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions.\\n\\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives.\\n\\nLastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision.\\n\\nSeeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.                     5         958             Seeking multiple opinions     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

The author of this article seems to be in full support of pursuing the dangerous planet, but why thats what I'm here to tell you.\\n\\nFirst I'll begin with a description of some of the harshness of the planet. \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.\" That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Those are some harsh conditions. The author seems to be with the idea of exploring Venus. There are some very interesting things that the author brings up such as \"a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" this seems to prove that it could be possible but what about power, the temperature, and air pressure well the author also included that. \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful.\" So then what about the danger of radiation well it turns out that that is also brought up. \"Radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" so that explains almost all the troubles of this trip and exploration, but there won't be much to see through all the clouds and the fact that going to the ground is too dangerous what could you possibly do. The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest.                     3         337                       Exploring Venus  Text dependent                                                                                                       In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's \"twin\", but there both the same only because of the density and size. Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus.\\n\\nVenus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. For example, in the text it says,\" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.\\n\\nExploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it. People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing. For example, in the text it states, \" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" This is explaining how bad the planet really is.\\n\\nNo spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus. The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself. For example, in the text it explains,\" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees. So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.                        2         368                       Exploring Venus  Text dependent                                                                                                       In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Children tend to not want to say much or tell the teachers how they really feel about a homework assignment or how boring their class really is. With the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System teachers and administrators can view how the students really feel about the way things are devised. This technology can perceive and recognize the subtle facial movements of humans based off a still image of the person. The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to read students' emotional expresions in the classroom and help schools become more sufficient.\\n\\nIn the article the author says \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.\" Some type of software is seeing what one takes interest in and making it a priority to stay consistent. School could be the same way. If the Facial Action Coding System sees that during a specific activity or certain topic students are engaged and very pleased with the task, it could help the school follow up with those types of tasks more often. The author quotes Dr. Hang by saying \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" What Dr. Hang is initially saying is, if the computers have the asset of detecting if students are confused or having trouble the new technology could transfer that to teachers. He also says \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intstructor.\" Sometimes students have trouble asking the teacher for assistance. Or some things just may be too hard for them, but they will never say anything. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, lessons can change to where as it approaches each student differently. This could possibly provide a boost to essential test scores for a school. However, not to say that the software could potentially read the emotions of others wrong, because in some cases humans tend to have a look on their face that contradicts their actual emotion. Not to mention the software is compared against a neutral face. That means that the software is going off of a blank expression extracting a emotion from it. But, that's what makes the Facial Action Coding System so unique and valuable because students often have blank expressions protrayed on their face anyhow.\\n\\nAll in all, the Facial Action Coding System could be a great value to assist instructors in reading students emotions in the classroom. Not only could it give a stepping stone to major test scores, but it could assist school becoming students best interest.                                         4         483           Facial action coding system  Text dependent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

According to the article\\n\\n\"What Is the Electoral College\"\\n\\nby the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" Basically we vote for our electors which then they vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?\\n\\nThere are many resons why people are in favor of changing the Electoral College for popular vote. In the article\\n\\n\"Why  even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\"\\n\\nby Bradford Plumer he asks \"Can voters  control whom their electors vote for?\" Then answers himself with \"Not always.\" This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in thier electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote they would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to make the right decisions for them, is they same basic thing but having electors are just another step.\\n\\n\"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\" This was stated in the article \"\\n\\nFive reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"\\n\\nby Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes.\\n\\nWhen it comes to popular voting there have been times where no canidate has a mojority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In  1968 Nixon received 43 percent pluraltiy or more votes than the other canidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same with Clinton in 1992 but they both won majority in the Electroral College, so there was no need for and run-off election.\\n\\nI believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.\\n\\nsincerly,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME                        4         459      Does the electoral college work?

NASA hasn't yet found a way to have a rocketship to last on the palnet, so let alone a person could last up there. The longest a rocket has lasted on the planet was three weeks. NASA is still working on a way to send a rocket and people onto Venus wothout failing.\\n\\nVenus is supposed to be the Earth's twin. Venus has the closest density, size and occasionally the cloest planet in distance too. This planet is the second planext from the Earth. All the planets orbit the sun at different speeds, and sometimes Eath is closer to Mars and other times it is closer to Venus. Venus is called the \"Evening star\"\\n\\nAt the begining no space craft had survived on Venus for hours, but one of the space crafts have lasted for three weeks. They may call Venus Earth's twin but it isnt a livable place. The pressuure of the planet is 90 times grater than Earth's. Venus has a very thick atmospere of 97% carbon dixide. The conditions are far to extreme to humans. The enviorment would be able to crush even a submarine that can take a lot of water pressure at the deepest point, Venus would liquefy the metal.\\n\\nVenus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system. Even thought Mercury is the closest planet to the sun Venus is still hottest within heat and pressure. The temeture is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is also almost sea level on Earth. The enviorment is very rocky, it has many valleys, mountains ans crates. It has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. They say Venus used to be covered in Oceans.\\n\\nNASA is doing hundreds of projects to get a space craft to land on Venus and to explore Venus. NASA is experimenting with mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. Its very shocking that modern computers can't last up on Venus. Modent computers do not have the gears and leavels that the mechanical computer has. That computer is much more controlable and is not more lyable to have problems.\\n\\nAll together Venus is not a livable planet, yet and probally will not be one for a while. A human can live on Venus but it will be very hard to live on. As i said before it has 97% of Carbon dioxide and is more likely gonna be very hard to breath. Venus is very very hot at 170 degrees fahrenheit. The air pressure is really close to sea leavels on Earth imagine how hard it is to breath there. The planet is very rocky and has many valleys, moutains and caters. Let's not forget that you may wake up to erupting volcanos, powerful eathquakes, and freguent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land its surface. That all happens on the planet Venus.

This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!\\n\\nBecause of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.\\n\\nAccording to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.\\n\\nFlorida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the \"swing\" states to win \"the people's\" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the \"swing\" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery. Many people will thank you!                         6         724      Does the electoral college work?

But, Venus is a very dangerous place. It is very hot, and it has very strong winds. It is also mostly Carbon Dioxide, which is deadly to humans if too much of it is inhaled. But, despite all of that, the author believes it is worth a chance giving it a deeper look.\\n\\nIt was said earlier on in the article that no space probe has landed on venus in nearly three decades. We got close, we explored the outside of venus to get a good look at it's yellow color, but its been awhile since we struck ground on the deadly planet. They say that Venus is Earth-like. For example, it is said that Venus is home to craters, valleys, mountains, etc.. Just like here on Earth. The Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, are all examples of what we have on Earth that could be similar to what is on Venus. If Venus is as hot as it is, there are probably volcanoes located somewhere on Venus, if not all over.\\n\\nWhich brings back the point that the author believes that it is worth studying Venus depsite the dangers. We would never know for sure what is on Venus if it goes without studying. The Earth-like structure is more or less a belief. Plus, if no probe has landed on the surface of Venus in three decades, then Venus could've changed massively and we wouldn't know how much of a change it has because we can't land on Venus. It isn't our fault that we can't land though, as Venus' clouds are very thick. The atmosphere itself is very thick on Venus, which makes it harder for exploration to occur. It was said probes can't last for more than a few hours.\\n\\nThe point is, if we can't explore Venus we may not truly know what lies beneath the clouds. The author believes that the exploration of Venus is worth pursuing even though it is dangerous. They believe that we should explore Venus. In paragraph 8, the author says, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" That is a powerful quote. It shows that we, as humans should not let fears get in the way of exploring to open up our imagination. The author is syaing that we shouldn't not explore Venus because of the dangers, but that we should continue exploring. We shouldn't let dangers and doubts limit our exploration. Our travels should instead be expanded because of imagination. Imagination goes a long way, and if we can get past these dangers, and explore Venus, then we can get to the edge of imagination. But, we can extend that imagination, and take exploration further. This goes not only for the exploration of Venus, but for any person in general. Don't let dangers and doubts stop you from seeing your imagination through, in some cirumstances. If it is very dangerous then it's not safe, but in a situation like this, we go unmanned.\\n\\nAnd so, we should explore Venus. The author thinks that explortion is a worthy pursui despite the dangers because of imagination and innovation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Venus is, well hard to explore due to the dangers it presents. Thick atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon Dioxide. Storms and strong winds. Extreme heat. However, the author believes that we shouldn't let those dangers stop us. We shouldn't let the dangers of Venus stop our exploration forever. Instead, the author thinks that we should instead be powered by imagination and innovation to explore Venus. Let our ideas and our minds take us into a world we have yet to uncover. We have uncovered some of Venus, but not much. It has been 30 years since we landed an unmanned spacecraft on Venus. The author thinks that we should let our ideas fuel the engine that explores Venus. And uncover some of its secrets that were hiding from us all along.                      4         682                       Exploring Venus  Text dependent                                                                                                       In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

When you use your car people are making money. People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive.\\n\\nIf you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter car                          1         331                       Car-free cities  Text dependent                                                                                        Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

Therefore scientist's have also found that when the person gets other peoples opinions, that the person normally chooses the better opinion and makes the better choice. Also when you get other people's opinions you get more and more knowledge about the choice that you are about to make. Another thing is when the person gives you their opinion don't deny their opinion, you need to listen to what they have to say and don't just ignore them.\\n\\nSecondly, you should never let someone encourage you to make a choice, but you should let someone tell you their opinion that away you know what you might like and want you don't like. For example say that your going out and looking for a job you might ask your friends that worked at one of the jobs that you are looking at, and they might tell you their opinion about the job. So then you can go and research about the job and see if you like it or not, then now you are ready for the job and you now know what to kinda expect.\\n\\nFurthermore, sometimes it might be good to ask your friends for their opinion on things, but other times it might not be the best time. Like say that you want to go to a football game with one of your friends, but your friend doesnt like the football teams that you are going to watch so that might not be a good time to ask for your friends opinion. So some of the time you might have to make your own choice and you might not be able to ask for your friends opinion.\\n\\nLastly, honestly when your making like a major decision in your life, I would honestly use your gut to make the choice instead of asking for your friends opinion. Then other times when it's not such a major decison then I would maybe ask your friends. So just remeber the next time your making a big or small decision maybe ask your friends for their opinions first then make the decision.                     4         365             Seeking multiple opinions     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the canidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad.  As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.\\n\\nThe electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false.  As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitly creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winner-takes-all system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense.  Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashaimed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.\\n\\nWhen the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people.  In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated.  The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling  the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and dissapointment.  The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state.  This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed.  Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.                                 4         479      Does the electoral college work?

The reason i say that is becuase if someone feeling sad or down you can use the 3-D computer technology.`This technology really will help alot with clssrooms. This technology maybe make the world a better place. If you can tell how somebody is feeling with asking them you will know how to come off to that person.\\n\\nThe 3-D technology is so great. They read face experssions, modify test. They just know when you like something or you dont .The 3-D technology will be a huge step for the classrooms. It will help more and it really will take load off the teachers becuase if the students doesn't know will computer will teach them.\\n\\nIn the text it say's that if you make a bad face to a ad on the browser the ad will not be like the other one you didn't like. And if you simle at an ad the next one will be more simlar to the one you like. Its a good thing for your phone or PC to able to read your face experssion and can tell when you like something or when you don't. Another thing is if you work to hard or you don't understand, the 3-D can modify the test or work in other words it modify the work to the best way you can understand.\\n\\nI think they should the use the 3-D technology step.

Having required time for other things for school will be too much and overwhelm many students, causing lower grades and higher stress. Some kids can't go to any afterschool extracurricular activity because of family problems, or their parents may not be able to bring them to where-ever they may need to go. If there are extracurricular activities going on during school time, some students may miss class work and be left behind, making more homework, making more stress and less sleep.\\n\\nSince every student is required to be in 'at least one extracurricular activity', then teachers will be overwhelmed as well. Teachers already have to get to school earlier than students do, and they have to work at home as well. Making their jobs harder with the same pay won't be helpful for anyone. Students could be spending their time more wisely than being forced to serve in student council. Teachers would have less time to work (or sleep) with now having to manage a new project for school.\\n\\nSetting up extracurricular activies requires work too, getting someone to set them up will take time and money, and it won't be worth it if no one wants to be a part of it. Student council doesn't seem useful or important in Middle school and sports shouldn't be required because some students could live too far away, or could be incapable of playing any games.\\n\\nHaving required extracurricular activities would simply make school more busy and may lower students grades. If it were up to the students to decide, it would be pretty clear what we would want.                                                                           3         325  Mandatory extracurricular activities     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.\\n\\nStudents usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,\\n\\nBy letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.\\n\\nWhen teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.\\n\\nIt could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.\\n\\nThere is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.                     5         693                       Summer projects     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

You don't only help people, but you also get a benefit of seeing amazing places. If you love animals you can take care of them. You get to have fun and know that you're doing something that helps others.\\n\\nLuke was just a small town boy and he got a great opportunity. First he had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank. Luke was invited to be a Seagoing Cowboy by his friend Don. He accepted it and knew he was going to have a lifetime opportunity. Luke had a benefit of seeing Europe and China, saw the Acropolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.\\n\\nThis job may be fun, but it still is a life changing experience. You see more than you could see just from home. You also know you're changing other people's lives. Luke may have had a wonderous adventure, but it also made him more aware of the needs in other countries.                     2         185         \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\"  Text dependent                                                                                                                   You have just read the article, 'A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'

It offers little benefits and raises a multitude of new issues to deal with. It could hinder the student learning process and leave them with a less then satisfactory education. It could also stifle the way in which young children and young adults develop important social skills which are needed in the modern world.\\n\\nMost students are lazy and tired of the same mundane routine of doing school work day in and day out. The only thing which keeps them on task is a teacher which is ever present helping them learn and grow, so what would happen if there was no teacher to monitor these students. The students would never accomplish anything meaningful, because they would have too many distractions all around them at home such as TV, video games, snacks, and many more enticing appliances and goods to steer their attention from that of education.\\n\\nStudents need teachers present to help them with their studies more than anything else in their learning career. A teacher over video or call could be less efficient and more irritated by the technology which could seriously hinder the student learning experience and the teachers ability to teach. Many older and more experienced teachers could find it hard to adapt to the new technology or outright refuse to use it out of frustration. This would restrict those students at home from getting the best possible education from the most experienced of teachers.\\n\\nStudents need a healthy and large dose of social interaction with other students to properly develop important social skills. Students need this sort of interaction and it plays a key role in not just their education, but their entire life. A long distance learning program could shut these particular students off from the rest of society causing many unseen mental and physical effects. These students would then be unprepared fof the challenges ahead in life and leave them at a disadvantage when compared to other students.\\n\\nWhat about students with disabilities? Wouldnt it be easier for both the school system and the student with the disability to just stay at home? Most school systems already have a well organized and defined public transportation system to take them to school and many schools already offer specialized classes and programs specifically for these less gifted students. What if the student is sick or wants to stay at home? Schools already are integrated well enough into the internet that teachers can give them assignments and classwork while they are at home sick and if a students wants to work from home there is always the option of home schooling and private tutors.\\n\\nIn the end, most students are better off just going to school and learning under the guidance of physical teachers and interacting with other students in the school environment. Long distance learning programs offer more issues than benefits and would stifle the way in which students learn and grow in many different ways. This is why long distance learning programs are not a viable alternative to traditional schools.                     5         504                     Distance learning     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

Some , well many, that we do not even know about. Now many believe the face on Mars was created my aliens. But, how could it be so? Well, because it was not.\\n\\nFirst of all how could have the aliens created an artifact. How they create it as a form of a face. It's not like aliens just have tools laying around and they sculpt when they are bored. It started to form over the years. The way it was forming and the shadows around it just made it look more of a face.\\n\\nWith all honesty do you not think if NASA was 100% sure this \"face\" was created by aliens they would've announced it? That would have been big proof that aliens do exist. After all scientists have been trying to look for any other life on other planets for over the years. So that just says NASA also sees it as just a natrual landform.\\n\\nThe face on Mars is became very popular. But not in the scientist type way. It has become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film,appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout likes for 25 years. Peopl seem to find it interesting since they are talking and mentioning it alot. I am thinking they just seem to find it interesting that aliens might have created it.\\n\\nI think it is safe to say that the face on Mars is just a natrual landform. NASA thinks that, so maybe we shoud too. After all they are scientist and part of NASA that knows all this. Later on I know that they will fnd other thing more evidence. People might have something new to believe.                                               3         317                      The Face on Mars  Text dependent                                                                                                         You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.\\n\\nSome students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.                     5         708  Mandatory extracurricular activities     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

I know that they may have stuff to do with friends, but school activities come before social life. Community service is helpful for our city. It can help in many ways, for example putting an ad in the newspaper for cleaning houses.\\n\\nThe principal is the boss of the school and could make up his own rules when he or she feels is needed. Even if the principal cannot make the students do community service, she can at least do a school speech about how our city needs to be clean.\\n\\nMaybe the principal could bribe the students with a prize for the school if they all do community service. For instance, they could all go to a amusement park at the end of the year. The point is, wouldn't you want to have a clean environment and want to be able to breath in fresh air. Community service is not a punishment, it is a healthy way make our society clean.\\n\\nAfter you have served the community service you will have enough time to do what have had planned. I would understand if you played sports for the school and had a team practice, but other than that you should be there. The principal should put a law that if you don't attend community service you don't go to this school.                           2         241                     Community service     Independent                                                  Some of your friends perform community service. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. They think helping the community is very important.

It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people.\\n\\nSource 2 states that the Electoral college is unfair for the voters because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad.\\n\\nIn the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business.\\n\\nVoters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want.\\n\\nArticle 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.\\n\\nDoing away with the Electoral Cololege is the best thing to do for the people. IT's unfair and tricky. The people deserve to be respected and not cheated out of their vote by electors.                           3         315      Does the electoral college work?

Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions.\\n\\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives.\\n\\nLastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision.\\n\\nSeeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>958</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

The author of this article seems to be in full support of pursuing the dangerous planet, but why thats what I'm here to tell you.\\n\\nFirst I'll begin with a description of some of the harshness of the planet. \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.\" That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Those are some harsh conditions. The author seems to be with the idea of exploring Venus. There are some very interesting things that the author brings up such as \"a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" this seems to prove that it could be possible but what about power, the temperature, and air pressure well the author also included that. \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful.\" So then what about the danger of radiation well it turns out that that is also brought up. \"Radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" so that explains almost all the troubles of this trip and exploration, but there won't be much to see through all the clouds and the fact that going to the ground is too dangerous what could you possibly do. The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest.</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>337</td>\n","      <td>Exploring Venus</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's \"twin\", but there both the same only because of the density and size. Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus.\\n\\nVenus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. For example, in the text it says,\" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.\\n\\nExploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it. People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing. For example, in the text it states, \" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" This is explaining how bad the planet really is.\\n\\nNo spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus. The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself. For example, in the text it explains,\" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees. So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>368</td>\n","      <td>Exploring Venus</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Children tend to not want to say much or tell the teachers how they really feel about a homework assignment or how boring their class really is. With the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System teachers and administrators can view how the students really feel about the way things are devised. This technology can perceive and recognize the subtle facial movements of humans based off a still image of the person. The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to read students' emotional expresions in the classroom and help schools become more sufficient.\\n\\nIn the article the author says \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.\" Some type of software is seeing what one takes interest in and making it a priority to stay consistent. School could be the same way. If the Facial Action Coding System sees that during a specific activity or certain topic students are engaged and very pleased with the task, it could help the school follow up with those types of tasks more often. The author quotes Dr. Hang by saying \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" What Dr. Hang is initially saying is, if the computers have the asset of detecting if students are confused or having trouble the new technology could transfer that to teachers. He also says \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intstructor.\" Sometimes students have trouble asking the teacher for assistance. Or some things just may be too hard for them, but they will never say anything. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, lessons can change to where as it approaches each student differently. This could possibly provide a boost to essential test scores for a school. However, not to say that the software could potentially read the emotions of others wrong, because in some cases humans tend to have a look on their face that contradicts their actual emotion. Not to mention the software is compared against a neutral face. That means that the software is going off of a blank expression extracting a emotion from it. But, that's what makes the Facial Action Coding System so unique and valuable because students often have blank expressions protrayed on their face anyhow.\\n\\nAll in all, the Facial Action Coding System could be a great value to assist instructors in reading students emotions in the classroom. Not only could it give a stepping stone to major test scores, but it could assist school becoming students best interest.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>483</td>\n","      <td>Facial action coding system</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

According to the article\\n\\n\"What Is the Electoral College\"\\n\\nby the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" Basically we vote for our electors which then they vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?\\n\\nThere are many resons why people are in favor of changing the Electoral College for popular vote. In the article\\n\\n\"Why  even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\"\\n\\nby Bradford Plumer he asks \"Can voters  control whom their electors vote for?\" Then answers himself with \"Not always.\" This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in thier electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote they would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to make the right decisions for them, is they same basic thing but having electors are just another step.\\n\\n\"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\" This was stated in the article \"\\n\\nFive reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"\\n\\nby Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes.\\n\\nWhen it comes to popular voting there have been times where no canidate has a mojority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In  1968 Nixon received 43 percent pluraltiy or more votes than the other canidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same with Clinton in 1992 but they both won majority in the Electroral College, so there was no need for and run-off election.\\n\\nI believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.\\n\\nsincerly,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>459</td>\n","      <td>Does the electoral college work?</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

NASA is still working on a way to send a rocket and people onto Venus wothout failing.\\n\\nVenus is supposed to be the Earth's twin. Venus has the closest density, size and occasionally the cloest planet in distance too. This planet is the second planext from the Earth. All the planets orbit the sun at different speeds, and sometimes Eath is closer to Mars and other times it is closer to Venus. Venus is called the \"Evening star\"\\n\\nAt the begining no space craft had survived on Venus for hours, but one of the space crafts have lasted for three weeks. They may call Venus Earth's twin but it isnt a livable place. The pressuure of the planet is 90 times grater than Earth's. Venus has a very thick atmospere of 97% carbon dixide. The conditions are far to extreme to humans. The enviorment would be able to crush even a submarine that can take a lot of water pressure at the deepest point, Venus would liquefy the metal.\\n\\nVenus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system. Even thought Mercury is the closest planet to the sun Venus is still hottest within heat and pressure. The temeture is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is also almost sea level on Earth. The enviorment is very rocky, it has many valleys, mountains ans crates. It has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. They say Venus used to be covered in Oceans.\\n\\nNASA is doing hundreds of projects to get a space craft to land on Venus and to explore Venus. NASA is experimenting with mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. Its very shocking that modern computers can't last up on Venus. Modent computers do not have the gears and leavels that the mechanical computer has. That computer is much more controlable and is not more lyable to have problems.\\n\\nAll together Venus is not a livable planet, yet and probally will not be one for a while. A human can live on Venus but it will be very hard to live on. As i said before it has 97% of Carbon dioxide and is more likely gonna be very hard to breath. Venus is very very hot at 170 degrees fahrenheit. The air pressure is really close to sea leavels on Earth imagine how hard it is to breath there. The planet is very rocky and has many valleys, moutains and caters. Let's not forget that you may wake up to erupting volcanos, powerful eathquakes, and freguent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land its surface. That all happens on the planet Venus.

This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!\\n\\nBecause of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.\\n\\nAccording to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.\\n\\nFlorida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the \"swing\" states to win \"the people's\" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the \"swing\" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery.

But, Venus is a very dangerous place. It is very hot, and it has very strong winds. It is also mostly Carbon Dioxide, which is deadly to humans if too much of it is inhaled. But, despite all of that, the author believes it is worth a chance giving it a deeper look.\\n\\nIt was said earlier on in the article that no space probe has landed on venus in nearly three decades. We got close, we explored the outside of venus to get a good look at it's yellow color, but its been awhile since we struck ground on the deadly planet. They say that Venus is Earth-like. For example, it is said that Venus is home to craters, valleys, mountains, etc.. Just like here on Earth. The Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, are all examples of what we have on Earth that could be similar to what is on Venus. If Venus is as hot as it is, there are probably volcanoes located somewhere on Venus, if not all over.\\n\\nWhich brings back the point that the author believes that it is worth studying Venus depsite the dangers. We would never know for sure what is on Venus if it goes without studying. The Earth-like structure is more or less a belief. Plus, if no probe has landed on the surface of Venus in three decades, then Venus could've changed massively and we wouldn't know how much of a change it has because we can't land on Venus. It isn't our fault that we can't land though, as Venus' clouds are very thick. The atmosphere itself is very thick on Venus, which makes it harder for exploration to occur. It was said probes can't last for more than a few hours.\\n\\nThe point is, if we can't explore Venus we may not truly know what lies beneath the clouds. The author believes that the exploration of Venus is worth pursuing even though it is dangerous. They believe that we should explore Venus. In paragraph 8, the author says, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" That is a powerful quote. It shows that we, as humans should not let fears get in the way of exploring to open up our imagination. The author is syaing that we shouldn't not explore Venus because of the dangers, but that we should continue exploring. We shouldn't let dangers and doubts limit our exploration. Our travels should instead be expanded because of imagination. Imagination goes a long way, and if we can get past these dangers, and explore Venus, then we can get to the edge of imagination. But, we can extend that imagination, and take exploration further. This goes not only for the exploration of Venus, but for any person in general. Don't let dangers and doubts stop you from seeing your imagination through, in some cirumstances. If it is very dangerous then it's not safe, but in a situation like this, we go unmanned.\\n\\nAnd so, we should explore Venus. The author thinks that explortion is a worthy pursui despite the dangers because of imagination and innovation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Venus is, well hard to explore due to the dangers it presents. Thick atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon Dioxide. Storms and strong winds. Extreme heat. However, the author believes that we shouldn't let those dangers stop us. We shouldn't let the dangers of Venus stop our exploration forever. Instead, the author thinks that we should instead be powered by imagination and innovation to explore Venus. Let our ideas and our minds take us into a world we have yet to uncover. We have uncovered some of Venus, but not much. It has been 30 years since we landed an unmanned spacecraft on Venus. The author thinks that we should let our ideas fuel the engine that explores Venus. And uncover some of its secrets that were hiding from us all along.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>682</td>\n","      <td>Exploring Venus</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the canidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad.  As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.\\n\\nThe electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false.  As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitly creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winner-takes-all system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense.  Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashaimed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.\\n\\nWhen the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people.  In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated.  The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling  the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and dissapointment.  The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state.  This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed.  Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>479</td>\n","      <td>Does the electoral college work?</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

Having required time for other things for school will be too much and overwhelm many students, causing lower grades and higher stress. Some kids can't go to any afterschool extracurricular activity because of family problems, or their parents may not be able to bring them to where-ever they may need to go. If there are extracurricular activities going on during school time, some students may miss class work and be left behind, making more homework, making more stress and less sleep.\\n\\nSince every student is required to be in 'at least one extracurricular activity', then teachers will be overwhelmed as well. Teachers already have to get to school earlier than students do, and they have to work at home as well. Making their jobs harder with the same pay won't be helpful for anyone. Students could be spending their time more wisely than being forced to serve in student council. Teachers would have less time to work (or sleep) with now having to manage a new project for school.\\n\\nSetting up extracurricular activies requires work too, getting someone to set them up will take time and money, and it won't be worth it if no one wants to be a part of it. Student council doesn't seem useful or important in Middle school and sports shouldn't be required because some students could live too far away, or could be incapable of playing any games.\\n\\nHaving required extracurricular activities would simply make school more busy and may lower students grades.

In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.\\n\\nStudents usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,\\n\\nBy letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.\\n\\nWhen teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.\\n\\nIt could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.\\n\\nThere is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>693</td>\n","      <td>Summer projects</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

It could also stifle the way in which young children and young adults develop important social skills which are needed in the modern world.\\n\\nMost students are lazy and tired of the same mundane routine of doing school work day in and day out. The only thing which keeps them on task is a teacher which is ever present helping them learn and grow, so what would happen if there was no teacher to monitor these students. The students would never accomplish anything meaningful, because they would have too many distractions all around them at home such as TV, video games, snacks, and many more enticing appliances and goods to steer their attention from that of education.\\n\\nStudents need teachers present to help them with their studies more than anything else in their learning career. A teacher over video or call could be less efficient and more irritated by the technology which could seriously hinder the student learning experience and the teachers ability to teach. Many older and more experienced teachers could find it hard to adapt to the new technology or outright refuse to use it out of frustration. This would restrict those students at home from getting the best possible education from the most experienced of teachers.\\n\\nStudents need a healthy and large dose of social interaction with other students to properly develop important social skills. Students need this sort of interaction and it plays a key role in not just their education, but their entire life. A long distance learning program could shut these particular students off from the rest of society causing many unseen mental and physical effects. These students would then be unprepared fof the challenges ahead in life and leave them at a disadvantage when compared to other students.\\n\\nWhat about students with disabilities? Wouldnt it be easier for both the school system and the student with the disability to just stay at home? Most school systems already have a well organized and defined public transportation system to take them to school and many schools already offer specialized classes and programs specifically for these less gifted students. What if the student is sick or wants to stay at home? Schools already are integrated well enough into the internet that teachers can give them assignments and classwork while they are at home sick and if a students wants to work from home there is always the option of home schooling and private tutors.\\n\\nIn the end, most students are better off just going to school and learning under the guidance of physical teachers and interacting with other students in the school environment. Long distance learning programs offer more issues than benefits and would stifle the way in which students learn and grow in many different ways.

Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.\\n\\nSome students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time.

Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions.\\n\\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives.\\n\\nLastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision.\\n\\nSeeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.\",\n          \"How would you feel if you had to do an extracurricular activity even if you were already busy during the school week? Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot\\u00a0of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.\\n\\nSome students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.\",\n          \"Long distance schooling is not a effective way of teaching students. It offers little benefits and raises a multitude of new issues to deal with. It could hinder the student learning process and leave them with a\\u00a0less then satisfactory education. It could also stifle the way in which young children and young adults develop important social skills which are needed in the modern world.\\n\\nMost students are lazy and tired of the same mundane routine of doing school work day in and day out. The only thing which keeps them on task is a teacher which is\\u00a0ever present\\u00a0helping them learn and grow, so what would happen if there was no teacher to monitor these students. The students would never accomplish anything meaningful, because they would have too many distractions all around them at home such as TV, video games, snacks, and many more enticing appliances and goods to steer their attention from\\u00a0that of education.\\n\\nStudents need teachers present to help them with their studies more than anything else in their learning career. A teacher over video or call could be less efficient and more irritated by the technology which could seriously hinder the student learning experience and\\u00a0the teachers ability to teach. Many older and more experienced teachers could find it hard to adapt to the new technology or outright refuse to use it out of frustration. This would restrict those students at home from getting the best possible education\\u00a0from the most experienced of\\u00a0teachers.\\n\\nStudents need a healthy and large dose of social interaction with other students to properly develop important social skills. Students need this sort of interaction and it plays a key role in not just their education, but their entire life. A long distance learning program could shut these particular students off from the rest of society causing many unseen\\u00a0mental and physical effects. These students would then be unprepared fof the challenges ahead in life and leave them at a disadvantage when compared to other students.\\n\\nWhat about students with disabilities? Wouldnt it be easier for both the school system and the student with the disability to just stay at home? Most school systems already have a well organized and defined public transportation system to take them to school and many schools already offer specialized classes and programs specifically for these less gifted students. What if the student is sick or wants to stay at home? Schools already are integrated well enough into the internet that teachers can give them assignments and classwork while they are at home sick and if a students wants to work from home there is always the option of home schooling and private tutors.\\n\\nIn the end, most students are better off just going to school and learning under the guidance of physical teachers and interacting with other students in the school environment. Long distance learning programs offer more issues than benefits and would stifle the way in which students learn and grow in many different ways. This is why long distance learning programs are not a viable alternative to traditional schools.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"holistic_essay_score\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 6,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 6,\n        \"samples\": [\n          5,\n          3,\n          6\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"word_count\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 198,\n        \"min\": 185,\n        \"max\": 958,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 20,\n        \"samples\": [\n          958,\n          708,\n          504\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"prompt_name\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Mandatory extracurricular activities\",\n          \"Seeking multiple opinions\",\n          \"The Face on Mars\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"task\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Text dependent\",\n          \"Independent\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"assignment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 11,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

The essay begins with a clear claim supporting the maintenance of the Electoral College, emphasizing that it is \"for the best\" because it is \"unfair to voters.\" However, the main argument shifts towards advocating for change by asserting that the Electoral College can be replaced by election through popular vote without stating or fully addressing the original claim.\n","\n","The essay effectively uses two sources, integrating them into the discussion of the Electoral College's disadvantages. It cites information about candidates focusing only on swing states during elections and mentions instances where voters in certain regions do not receive visits from presidential campaigns or campaign advertisements. The student also discusses the lack of direct control voters have over electors' decisions.\n","\n","However, the essay could benefit from more explicit reference to both sides of the argument, which is particularly weak since it transitions away from supporting the Electoral College mid-way through without a clear rebuttal addressing potential counterarguments against its abolition or modification. The student acknowledges concerns about electors potentially voting contrary to their state's preference but does not fully address this issue.\n","\n","A stronger essay would have balanced the arguments more effectively, critiquing both sides and then presenting a well-reasoned conclusion that supports or refines the position being argued for. In addition, while there is some mention of how the Electoral College works as per Article 1 of the Constitution, this explanation could be expanded upon to provide more context and support for the argument.\n","\n","Overall, the essay demonstrates an adequate grasp of the issue at hand but lacks a cohesive structure that maintains focus on its initial claim. The final grade reflects these aspects, indicating that while there are some strengths in addressing key points and using sources effectively, there is room for improvement in argument coherence and balance.\n","The dataset score is: 3\n","Time Generation: 10.01477837562561 \n","\n","avarage time for qwen2 1.5b 2.6011250495910643\n","Model Name:: mistral\n","question_word_count 33\n","answer_word_count 958\n","The Model Score is:: 4.5 (Rounded from a weighted average of the aspects you provided, taking into account that Lead and Position were not directly addressed, but the content is generally well-structured and meets most requirements.)\n","The dataset score is: 5\n","Time Generation: 28.31092882156372 \n","\n","question_word_count 83\n","answer_word_count 337\n","The Model Score is:: 3.5\n","The dataset score is: 3\n","Time Generation: 0.6264619827270508 \n","\n","question_word_count 83\n","answer_word_count 368\n","The Model Score is:: 3.5 (rounded to 3)\n","The dataset score is: 2\n","Time Generation: 0.7783472537994385 \n","\n","question_word_count 53\n","answer_word_count 483\n","The Model Score is:: 4.5\n","The dataset score is: 4\n","Time Generation: 0.7133114337921143 \n","\n","question_word_count 102\n","answer_word_count 459\n","The Model Score is:: 4\n","\n","Explanation: The essay provides a clear claim, addresses counterclaims, uses evidence from multiple sources, and includes a concluding summary.

make a decision that will affect you for the rest of your life? Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions.\\n\\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives.\\n\\nLastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision.\\n\\nSeeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.                     5         958             Seeking multiple opinions     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

effective in grabbing the reader's attention. It gets a score of 0.5.\\n* **Position (2 points)**: The student clearly explains why seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. They provide specific details and examples, which supports their position. Score: 1.5\\n* **Counterclaim (2 points)**: The essay does not explicitly address potential counterarguments or opposing views.\\n* **Rebuttal (2 points)**: Since the counterclaim section is missing, there's no rebuttal to score.\\n* **Evidence (3 points)**: The student uses examples from personal experience and provides relevant details to support their claims. However, some of the examples feel a bit disconnected from the main argument. Score: 2\\n* **Concluding Summary (1 point)**: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points, but it's not particularly strong or memorable.\\n\\nOverall, the essay demonstrates some strengths in providing specific details and examples to support the argument. However, there are areas for improvement, such as addressing counterarguments and improving the lead.                    39.861362

The Challange of Exploring Venus is the name of this article that I have just read. The author of this article seems to be in full support of pursuing the dangerous planet, but why thats what I'm here to tell you.\\n\\nFirst I'll begin with a description of some of the harshness of the planet. \"A thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.\" That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Those are some harsh conditions. The author seems to be with the idea of exploring Venus. There are some very interesting things that the author brings up such as \"a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" this seems to prove that it could be possible but what about power, the temperature, and air pressure well the author also included that. \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful.\" So then what about the danger of radiation well it turns out that that is also brought up. \"Radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" so that explains almost all the troubles of this trip and exploration, but there won't be much to see through all the clouds and the fact that going to the ground is too dangerous what could you possibly do. The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest.                     3         337                       Exploring Venus  Text dependent                                                                                                       In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents. Using details from the article, write an essay evaluating how well the author supports this idea. Be sure to include: a claim that evaluates how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers; an explanation of the evidence from the article that supports your claim; an introduction, a body, and a conclusion to your essay.

The introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement that evaluates how well the author supports the idea of studying Venus despite its dangers.\\n* **Position:** (0.5/1) The student presents a vague claim that they don't think we know enough about the planet to determine whether going there is in our best interest, which doesn't directly address the author's support for studying Venus.\\n* **Counterclaim:** (0.5/1) Although the student mentions some of the challenges of exploring Venus, their counterargument is not explicitly stated or effectively argued against the author's position.\\n* **Rebuttal:** (0.5/1) The student does present some evidence from the article to support their claim, but it lacks depth and analysis.\\n* **Evidence:** (1/2) Some relevant quotes from the article are included, but they are not thoroughly explained or analyzed in relation to the author's argument.\\n* **Concluding Summary:** (0.5/1) The conclusion is brief and fails to effectively summarize the student's argument and reiterate their claim.\\n\\nThe essay lacks a clear structure, and the student's thoughts and ideas seem to be presented in a somewhat disjointed manner. Additionally, there are no transitions between paragraphs or sentences, making it difficult to follow the student's line of reasoning.                     9.957883

The author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents because the planet itself is dangerous. Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's \"twin\", but there both the same only because of the density and size. Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus.\\n\\nVenus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. For example, in the text it says,\" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.\\n\\nExploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it. People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing. For example, in the text it states, \" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" This is explaining how bad the planet really is.\\n\\nNo spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus. The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself. For example, in the text it explains,\" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees. So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.                        2         368                       Exploring Venus  Text dependent                                                                                                       In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

of 6.\\n\\nHere's my breakdown:\\n\\n**Lead (1 point)**: The introduction is clear and concise, but it doesn't effectively evaluate how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Score: 0.5/1\\n\\n**Position (2 points)**: The student's claim is straightforward, but it's not particularly nuanced or well-supported. They fail to acknowledge any potential benefits of studying Venus and focus solely on its dangers. Score: 1/2\\n\\n**Counterclaim (1 point)**: There is no clear counterargument presented in the essay. While the student mentions some challenges associated with exploring Venus, they don't address any potential counterarguments or alternative perspectives. Score: 0/1\\n\\n**Rebuttal (2 points)**: The student attempts to refute potential counterarguments by citing evidence from the article, but their responses are often simplistic and fail to provide adequate support for their claims. Score: 1/2\\n\\n**Evidence (3 points)**: While the student cites some relevant evidence from the article, they often misinterpret or misunderstand it. For example, they state that Venus has a \"thick atmosphere\" without considering its implications, and they incorrectly compare Earth's temperature to Venus'. Score: 2/3\\n\\n**Concluding Summary (2 points)**: The conclusion is brief and fails to effectively summarize the student's main arguments. It simply restates their claim without providing any final thoughts or reflections on the topic.

Children tend to not want to say much or tell the teachers how they really feel about a homework assignment or how boring their class really is. With the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System teachers and administrators can view how the students really feel about the way things are devised. This technology can perceive and recognize the subtle facial movements of humans based off a still image of the person. The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to read students' emotional expresions in the classroom and help schools become more sufficient.\\n\\nIn the article the author says \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.\" Some type of software is seeing what one takes interest in and making it a priority to stay consistent. School could be the same way. If the Facial Action Coding System sees that during a specific activity or certain topic students are engaged and very pleased with the task, it could help the school follow up with those types of tasks more often. The author quotes Dr. Hang by saying \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" What Dr. Hang is initially saying is, if the computers have the asset of detecting if students are confused or having trouble the new technology could transfer that to teachers. He also says \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intstructor.\" Sometimes students have trouble asking the teacher for assistance. Or some things just may be too hard for them, but they will never say anything. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, lessons can change to where as it approaches each student differently. This could possibly provide a boost to essential test scores for a school. However, not to say that the software could potentially read the emotions of others wrong, because in some cases humans tend to have a look on their face that contradicts their actual emotion. Not to mention the software is compared against a neutral face. That means that the software is going off of a blank expression extracting a emotion from it. But, that's what makes the Facial Action Coding System so unique and valuable because students often have blank expressions protrayed on their face anyhow.\\n\\nAll in all, the Facial Action Coding System could be a great value to assist instructors in reading students emotions in the classroom. Not only could it give a stepping stone to major test scores, but it could assist school becoming students best interest.                                         4         483           Facial action coding system  Text dependent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

Lead (4/6): The lead is a bit unclear and could be more engaging. It should introduce the topic, the article, and the author's argument in a more interesting manner to grab the reader's attention. Score: 3/6\\n* Position (2/6): The response does not clearly state its position on whether the use of this technology is valuable or not. While it discusses the benefits, it lacks a clear stance. Score: 1/6\\n* Counterclaim (2/6): The essay does not present any counterarguments or potential drawbacks to the use of this technology, which weakens the overall argument. Score: 1/6\\n* Rebuttal (2/6): There is no rebuttal section in the response, which means the writer has not addressed opposing viewpoints or provided evidence to support their claims.

Score: 2/6\\n* Concluding Summary (3/6): The conclusion reiterates the benefits but does not summarize the main points effectively or offer a final thought. It could be more impactful and concise.

It sets up the potential benefits of using the Facial Action Coding System in schools, but it could be more effective if it explicitly stated the thesis or argument that will be made throughout the essay.\\n\\n2. **Position**: The student presents a clear argument for why the Facial Action Coding System is valuable in reading students' emotional expressions in the classroom. They provide examples from the article to support their claim and explain how this technology can help schools become more effective in teaching.\\n\\n3. **Counterclaim**: Unfortunately, the student doesn't address potential counterarguments or limitations of using the Facial Action Coding System. This is a crucial aspect of an argumentative essay, as it allows for a more nuanced discussion and strengthens the overall argument.\\n\\n4. **Rebuttal**: The student attempts to address some potential concerns (e.g., the software might misinterpret emotions), but their responses are brief and not particularly convincing.\\n\\n5. **Evidence**: The student uses relevant examples from the article to support their claim, which is a strength of this essay.\\n\\n6. **Concluding Summary**: The conclusion summarizes the main points made in the essay, but it doesn't provide any new insights or reiterate the thesis statement with conviction.\\n\\nOverall, while the student demonstrates some understanding of the topic and presents a clear argument, there are areas for improvement, particularly in addressing potential counterarguments and providing more convincing rebuttals.                    11.272995

State Senator:\\n\\nThe Electoral College is a very useful and easy was of voting. According to the article\\n\\n\"What Is the Electoral College\"\\n\\nby the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" Basically we vote for our electors which then they vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?\\n\\nThere are many resons why people are in favor of changing the Electoral College for popular vote. In the article\\n\\n\"Why  even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\"\\n\\nby Bradford Plumer he asks \"Can voters  control whom their electors vote for?\" Then answers himself with \"Not always.\" This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in thier electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote they would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to make the right decisions for them, is they same basic thing but having electors are just another step.\\n\\n\"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\" This was stated in the article \"\\n\\nFive reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"\\n\\nby Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes.\\n\\nWhen it comes to popular voting there have been times where no canidate has a mojority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In  1968 Nixon received 43 percent pluraltiy or more votes than the other canidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same with Clinton in 1992 but they both won majority in the Electroral College, so there was no need for and run-off election.\\n\\nI believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections. Even though some believe the Electoral College as an anachronism I think that the Electoral College is still a good way of voting.\\n\\nsincerly,\\n\\nPROPER_NAME                        4         459      Does the electoral college work?

However, the structure could be improved, with more developed paragraphs that flow smoothly into one another, and the essay could benefit from more polished language use to make it easier for the reader to understand the author's points. The evidence provided is relevant and effectively supports the argument, but it would be even stronger if the student could demonstrate a deeper understanding of the texts by quoting directly or summarizing more accurately. Additionally, the essay could benefit from some revisions and edits to eliminate errors in grammar, punctuation, and spelling. Overall, the essay is well-structured and effectively presents an argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College; however, it could be improved with some polishing and proofreading.                 5.312886            2 \\n                   0.353256                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         Lead (1-4): 2\\nPosition (1-4): 3\\nCounterclaim (1-4): 2\\nRebuttal (1-4): 3\\nEvidence (1-4): 2.5\\nConcluding Summary (1-4): 3\\nTotal Score: 18/24                   2.753607  I'll evaluate the student's response critically and objectively, focusing on the quality of the answer in relation to the assignment's requirements.\\n\\n**Total Score: 4**\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the student's performance:\\n\\n1. **Lead (0.5/1)**\\nThe introduction is brief and lacks a clear thesis statement. The writer introduces the topic but doesn't explicitly state their position on whether the Electoral College should be kept or changed.\\n2. **Position (0.8/1)**\\nThe writer argues in favor of keeping the Electoral College, citing its ability to prevent larger states from dominating the election and its role in preventing runoff elections. However, the reasoning is not fully developed, and some points are not adequately supported with evidence.\\n3. **Counterclaim (0.5/1)**\\nThe writer addresses one counterargument, which is that popular vote would give smaller states more influence. However, this response is brief and doesn't provide a robust counter to the opposing view.\\n4. **Rebuttal (0.5/1)**\\nThe writer attempts to rebut the counterclaim by arguing that voters can still influence their electors' choices. However, this response is weak and doesn't adequately address the concerns raised about popular vote.\\n5. **Evidence (0.8/1)**\\nThe writer cites four sources to support their argument. While this is a good effort, some of the evidence is not effectively integrated into the text, and there are no clear connections made between the evidence and the writer's claims.\\n6. **Concluding Summary (0.5/1)**\\nThe conclusion restates the writer's position without providing a clear summary of their main points or emphasizing the significance of their argument.\\n\\n**Strengths:**\\n\\n* The writer attempts to engage with multiple sources and perspectives on the issue.\\n* They identify some potential benefits of the Electoral College, such as preventing runoff elections.\\n\\n**Weaknesses:**\\n\\n* The writing lacks clarity, coherence, and organization.\\n* Many sentences are grammatically incorrect or contain errors in punctuation.\\n* The argument is not fully developed, and some points are not adequately supported with evidence.\\n* The writer fails to address most of the potential counterarguments and concerns about the Electoral College.\\n\\nOverall, while the student attempts to engage with the topic and provides some relevant evidence, their writing lacks depth, clarity, and coherence.                    16.848116  Based on the student's essay, I would give them a score of 4 out of 6.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\n\\n* Lead: 5/5 (The student clearly states their position and begins to explain why they believe the Electoral College should remain intact.)\\n* Position: 4/5 (While the student provides some strong arguments in favor of keeping the Electoral College, they could have delved deeper into these points and provided more specific examples.)\\n* Counterclaim: 3.5/5 (The student addresses potential counterclaims, but doesn't fully address them. For example, they mention that voters can control who their electors vote for, but don't fully explore the implications of this.)\\n* Rebuttal: 4/5 (The student provides some effective rebuttals to potential counterclaims, particularly in addressing concerns about larger states having more impact on the election.)\\n* Evidence: 4.5/5 (The student uses a variety of sources to support their argument, including multiple articles from different authors. However, they could have used more diverse sources to add depth and nuance to their argument.)\\n* Concluding Summary: 5/5 (The student effectively summarizes their main points and reiterates their position at the end of the essay.)\\n\\nOverall, while there are some areas for improvement, the student provides a clear and well-supported argument in favor of keeping the Electoral College.                     5.209497\n","8756   3BBD17BCB443                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Venus, Venus is known as Earths twin because of having similarity's. NASA hasn't yet found a way to have a rocketship to last on the palnet, so let alone a person could last up there. The longest a rocket has lasted on the planet was three weeks. NASA is still working on a way to send a rocket and people onto Venus wothout failing.\\n\\nVenus is supposed to be the Earth's twin. Venus has the closest density, size and occasionally the cloest planet in distance too. This planet is the second planext from the Earth. All the planets orbit the sun at different speeds, and sometimes Eath is closer to Mars and other times it is closer to Venus. Venus is called the \"Evening star\"\\n\\nAt the begining no space craft had survived on Venus for hours, but one of the space crafts have lasted for three weeks. They may call Venus Earth's twin but it isnt a livable place. The pressuure of the planet is 90 times grater than Earth's. Venus has a very thick atmospere of 97% carbon dixide. The conditions are far to extreme to humans. The enviorment would be able to crush even a submarine that can take a lot of water pressure at the deepest point, Venus would liquefy the metal.\\n\\nVenus has the hottest surface temperture of any planet in the solar system. Even thought Mercury is the closest planet to the sun Venus is still hottest within heat and pressure. The temeture is 170 degrees Fahrenheit. The air pressure is also almost sea level on Earth. The enviorment is very rocky, it has many valleys, mountains ans crates. It has erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and freguent lighting strikes to probes seeking to land on its surface. They say Venus used to be covered in Oceans.\\n\\nNASA is doing hundreds of projects to get a space craft to land on Venus and to explore Venus. NASA is experimenting with mechanical computers which were first envisioned in the 1800's and played an important role in the 1940's during World War II. Its very shocking that modern computers can't last up on Venus. Modent computers do not have the gears and leavels that the mechanical computer has. That computer is much more controlable and is not more lyable to have problems.\\n\\nAll together Venus is not a livable planet, yet and probally will not be one for a while. A human can live on Venus but it will be very hard to live on. As i said before it has 97% of Carbon dioxide and is more likely gonna be very hard to breath. Venus is very very hot at 170 degrees fahrenheit. The air pressure is really close to sea leavels on Earth imagine how hard it is to breath there. The planet is very rocky and has many valleys, moutains and caters. Let's not forget that you may wake up to erupting volcanos, powerful eathquakes, and freguent lightning stikes to probes seeking to land its surface. That all happens on the planet Venus.

The student argues that Venus is not a livable planet and presents evidence to support this claim, including information about the planet's extreme temperatures, pressure, and environment.\\n\\nEvidence: The student provides several pieces of evidence from the article, such as the longest time a rocket has lasted on Venus (three weeks), the thick atmosphere composed of 97% carbon dioxide, and the hostile environment with erupting volcanoes, powerful earthquakes, and frequent lightning strikes.\\n\\nPosition: The student presents a clear position that Venus is not a livable planet and provides evidence to support this claim. However, the argument could be strengthened by providing more specific details about the challenges of studying Venus and how they relate to the dangers presented by the planet's environment.\\n\\nRebuttal: The student has not provided any rebuttal to counterarguments that may arise in response to their claim. For example, some may argue that despite the extreme conditions on Venus, there could be unique opportunities for scientific discovery or exploration that outweigh the risks.\\n\\nCounterclaim: The student does not explicitly address potential counterclaims to their argument, such as the possibility of advanced technology in the future that could mitigate some of the dangers presented by Venus's environment.\\n\\nConcluding Summary: The student provides a clear and concise summary of their position, but could benefit from elaborating on how the challenges of studying Venus outweigh any potential benefits. Additionally, the conclusion does not fully address counterarguments or provide a comprehensive evaluation of the author's support for the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers.                  11.417192                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Based on the assignment requirements, I will evaluate the student's response critically and objectively.\\n\\n**Lead (1/2)**: The introduction lacks a clear thesis statement that evaluates how well the author supports the idea that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers. Instead, it presents some general information about Venus.\\n\\n**Position (3/5)**: The student argues that Venus is not a livable planet and highlights several reasons why it's extremely challenging for humans to survive there. However, this argument doesn't directly address the author's claim in \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus\" regarding the merits of studying Venus despite its dangers.\\n\\n**Counterclaim (2/5)**: The student mentions that NASA is working on sending a rocket and people to Venus without failing, but this counterargument isn't fully developed or linked back to the author's original claim.\\n\\n**Rebuttal (3/5)**: While the student presents some compelling evidence about the harsh conditions on Venus, the rebuttal could be stronger. It mainly focuses on the difficulties of living on Venus rather than addressing the author's argument directly.\\n\\n**Evidence (4/5)**: The student provides relevant details from the article to support their claims, such as the extreme heat and pressure on Venus. However, some of these points feel more like simple statements without explicit connections to the author's claim.\\n\\n**Concluding Summary (3/5)**: The conclusion restates the main arguments but doesn't effectively summarize the student's evaluation of the author's position. It ends with a rhetorical question instead of providing a clear final thought on the matter.\\n\\n**Final Grade:** 4                    11.717807                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 4                     0.454759\n","19303  671D0569C835                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Dear Florida State Senator,\\n\\nEvery 4 years, many people vote for a president they think will lead the United States to greatness; some, however, don't know that they are voting for the Electoral College to vote on their choise. This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!\\n\\nBecause of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.\\n\\nAccording to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.\\n\\nFlorida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the \"swing\" states to win \"the people's\" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the \"swing\" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery. Many people will thank you!                         6         724      Does the electoral college work?

           Based on the grading criteria, I evaluate the student's essay as follows:\\n\\n**Lead (1): 3**\\nThe lead is clear and concise, but it doesn't fully address the question. The student states that the Electoral College is \"not democratic\" without providing a clear argument or claim.\\n\\n**Position (2): 4**\\nThe position statement is strong, but it's not well-supported by evidence from multiple sources. The student relies heavily on general statements and examples, such as the 2000 election, to make their point.\\n\\n**Counterclaim (1): 3**\\nThe counterclaim is mentioned, but it's not fully addressed. The student mentions that some people might argue against changing the Electoral College, but they don't provide a clear argument or response to this counterclaim.\\n\\n**Rebuttal (2): 4**\\nThe rebuttal is strong, and the student provides evidence from multiple sources to support their claim. However, the rebuttal could be more effective if it directly addressed potential weaknesses in the student's own argument.\\n\\n**Evidence (3): 5**\\nThe student provides evidence from three different sources, which is a good effort. However, the evidence is not always well-integrated into the essay, and some of the quotes are not clearly referenced or explained.\\n\\n**Concluding Summary (1): 4**\\nThe concluding summary is strong, but it's not entirely effective in summarizing the main points of the essay. The student could have done a better job of synthesizing their arguments and evidence to make a clear and compelling case for abolishing the Electoral College.\\n\\n**Total Score: 23/30**\\n\\nNote that I did not provide an explanation of the score, as requested.                    12.723379                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Based on the grading criteria, I would give the student a total score of 3 out of 6.\\n\\nHere's the breakdown:\\n\\n* Lead: 2/5 (The essay starts with a clear claim, but it's somewhat vague and doesn't grab the reader's attention.)\\n* Position: 4/5 (The student presents a clear argument in favor of abolishing the Electoral College.)\\n* Counterclaim: 3/5 (The student addresses potential counterclaims, but could have done a better job of anticipating them and addressing them more thoroughly.)\\n* Rebuttal: 2/5 (The rebuttal is somewhat weak and doesn't effectively address any major concerns about the opposing viewpoint.)\\n* Evidence: 4/5 (The student provides some good evidence from multiple sources to support their claim, although could have done a better job of integrating the evidence more smoothly into the essay.)\\n* Concluding Summary: 3/5 (The conclusion is clear and reiterates the main point, but feels somewhat repetitive and could be stronger.)\\n\\nOverall, the student demonstrates a clear argument in favor of abolishing the Electoral College, but could benefit from some further development and refinement to make their argument even more compelling.                     4.963139\n","8566   B28CE3CD571D                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   The author seems to be engaged in the idea of exploring Venus. But, Venus is a very dangerous place. It is very hot, and it has very strong winds. It is also mostly Carbon Dioxide, which is deadly to humans if too much of it is inhaled. But, despite all of that, the author believes it is worth a chance giving it a deeper look.\\n\\nIt was said earlier on in the article that no space probe has landed on venus in nearly three decades. We got close, we explored the outside of venus to get a good look at it's yellow color, but its been awhile since we struck ground on the deadly planet. They say that Venus is Earth-like. For example, it is said that Venus is home to craters, valleys, mountains, etc.. Just like here on Earth. The Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, are all examples of what we have on Earth that could be similar to what is on Venus. If Venus is as hot as it is, there are probably volcanoes located somewhere on Venus, if not all over.\\n\\nWhich brings back the point that the author believes that it is worth studying Venus depsite the dangers. We would never know for sure what is on Venus if it goes without studying. The Earth-like structure is more or less a belief. Plus, if no probe has landed on the surface of Venus in three decades, then Venus could've changed massively and we wouldn't know how much of a change it has because we can't land on Venus. It isn't our fault that we can't land though, as Venus' clouds are very thick. The atmosphere itself is very thick on Venus, which makes it harder for exploration to occur. It was said probes can't last for more than a few hours.\\n\\nThe point is, if we can't explore Venus we may not truly know what lies beneath the clouds. The author believes that the exploration of Venus is worth pursuing even though it is dangerous. They believe that we should explore Venus. In paragraph 8, the author says, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" That is a powerful quote. It shows that we, as humans should not let fears get in the way of exploring to open up our imagination. The author is syaing that we shouldn't not explore Venus because of the dangers, but that we should continue exploring. We shouldn't let dangers and doubts limit our exploration. Our travels should instead be expanded because of imagination. Imagination goes a long way, and if we can get past these dangers, and explore Venus, then we can get to the edge of imagination. But, we can extend that imagination, and take exploration further. This goes not only for the exploration of Venus, but for any person in general. Don't let dangers and doubts stop you from seeing your imagination through, in some cirumstances. If it is very dangerous then it's not safe, but in a situation like this, we go unmanned.\\n\\nAnd so, we should explore Venus. The author thinks that explortion is a worthy pursui despite the dangers because of imagination and innovation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Venus is, well hard to explore due to the dangers it presents. Thick atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon Dioxide. Storms and strong winds. Extreme heat. However, the author believes that we shouldn't let those dangers stop us. We shouldn't let the dangers of Venus stop our exploration forever. Instead, the author thinks that we should instead be powered by imagination and innovation to explore Venus. Let our ideas and our minds take us into a world we have yet to uncover. We have uncovered some of Venus, but not much. It has been 30 years since we landed an unmanned spacecraft on Venus. The author thinks that we should let our ideas fuel the engine that explores Venus. And uncover some of its secrets that were hiding from us all along.                      4         682                       Exploring Venus  Text dependent                                                                                                       In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

                    **Total Score: 4**\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the score:\\n\\n* **Lead (0.5/1)**: The introduction is brief and doesn't effectively introduce the topic or provide context for the reader.\\n* **Position (0.8/1)**: The student takes a clear position on the author's argument, but it's not well-articulated. They seem to agree with the author that studying Venus is worth it, but they don't explain why this is so.\\n* **Counterclaim (0.7/1)**: The student presents some counterarguments against exploring Venus, such as its extreme environment and lack of recent landings on the planet. However, these points are not fully developed or supported with evidence from the article.\\n* **Rebuttal (0.8/1)**: The rebuttal is stronger than the counterclaim, but it's still a bit vague. The student quotes the author to support their position, but they don't explain how this quote addresses the potential dangers of exploring Venus.\\n* **Evidence (0.5/1)**: While the student mentions some facts from the article, such as the lack of recent landings on Venus and its extreme environment, they do not effectively use these points to support their argument. The evidence is presented in a somewhat superficial way.\\n* **Concluding Summary (0.7/1)**: The conclusion is clear but not particularly strong. It restates the main point without adding much new or insightful analysis.\\n\\nOverall, while the student attempts to address all aspects of the prompt, they do so with varying degrees of success.

When you use your car people are making money. People need a car to far away places fast. cars are expensive, thats because people keep adding on to it and making it more fancy and of corse its going to be more expencive.\\n\\nIf you limit cars most gas stations would be going out of bussniess and car places. gas stations buy the gas for cars to use yeah the gas is expensive but we need it and car dealerships would have so many cars they wouldnt know what to do with them cause no one would but them because there car would be limited to use so there car would be brand new. yes people are losseing alot of money from cars but its worth it cause we need to get places. if you make cars fancy yeah your going to have people to want to buy it but thats because you want them to buy it cars are killing the envirnment up though because the gas the people tearing into there grass people dont relize it but cars should just be used to get places and then stay there and then when there done go home. i mean if they can make a car that can scene if there drunk and wont start i would buy that car because it would tell you not to drive becaus eyou are drunk that will slove so many deaths and drunk driver accident problems. instead of making cars fast and look slicker and nicer and have the car talk to you with blootooth thats just dumb in my opion i wish they would just make cars more reasonable with things that really matter than just look nicer and more for rich people alot of people can afford cars so they should lower all prices and they would make more money becaus emore stuff will be sold like the drunk deceter car                          1         331                       Car-free cities  Text dependent                                                                                        Write an explanatory essay to inform fellow citizens about the advantages of limiting car usage.

                                                                                                                                                 So scientist's have researched and discovered that when someone is making a hard choice, people often ask others about their opinions. Therefore scientist's have also found that when the person gets other peoples opinions, that the person normally chooses the better opinion and makes the better choice. Also when you get other people's opinions you get more and more knowledge about the choice that you are about to make. Another thing is when the person gives you their opinion don't deny their opinion, you need to listen to what they have to say and don't just ignore them.\\n\\nSecondly, you should never let someone encourage you to make a choice, but you should let someone tell you their opinion that away you know what you might like and want you don't like. For example say that your going out and looking for a job you might ask your friends that worked at one of the jobs that you are looking at, and they might tell you their opinion about the job. So then you can go and research about the job and see if you like it or not, then now you are ready for the job and you now know what to kinda expect.\\n\\nFurthermore, sometimes it might be good to ask your friends for their opinion on things, but other times it might not be the best time. Like say that you want to go to a football game with one of your friends, but your friend doesnt like the football teams that you are going to watch so that might not be a good time to ask for your friends opinion. So some of the time you might have to make your own choice and you might not be able to ask for your friends opinion.\\n\\nLastly, honestly when your making like a major decision in your life, I would honestly use your gut to make the choice instead of asking for your friends opinion. Then other times when it's not such a major decison then I would maybe ask your friends. So just remeber the next time your making a big or small decision maybe ask your friends for their opinions first then make the decision.                     4         365             Seeking multiple opinions     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

the student's essay, I would give them a score of **4** out of 6.\\n\\nHere's my breakdown:\\n\\n* **Lead (1)**: The introduction is straightforward and clear, but it lacks a strong hook to grab the reader's attention. (0.8/1)\\n* **Position (2)**: The student presents a clear argument for seeking multiple opinions, citing research on people making better choices when they consider others' opinions. However, the language is simple and lacks depth. (1.6/2)\\n* **Counterclaim (1)**: The student acknowledges that there may be situations where it's not a good idea to seek multiple opinions, but this section feels tacked on and doesn't fully develop the counterargument. (0.8/1)\\n* **Rebuttal (1)**: The rebuttal is weak and lacks specific examples to effectively address potential concerns. (0.5/1)\\n* **Evidence (2)**: While the student mentions research, there's no clear explanation of what that research entails or how it supports their argument. This section feels underdeveloped. (1.3/2)\\n* **Concluding Summary (1)**: The conclusion is abrupt and doesn't summarize the main points effectively. (0.5/1)\\n\\nOverall, the student demonstrates a good understanding of the topic but struggles with presenting nuanced arguments and supporting their claims with evidence.                    10.043158

                                  The electoral college, a mistake?  Many Americans are unsatisfied with the electoral college and the system it follows.  The electoral college has disapointed millions of Americans of any social class.  According to\\n\\nThe Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong , by Bradford Plummer, \" Under the electoral college system, voters vote not for the president, but for a slate of the electors, who in turn elect the president.\"  America should abolish the electoral college as it has upset 60 percent of americans and elected unwanted Presidents.\\n\\n\"This year voters can expect another close election in which the polular vote winner could lose the presidency\", as said by Bradford Plummer.  Every year Americans fall stricken by dissapointment from the electoral college.  The system of the electoral college is a poor representation of american ideals as canidates do not even bother spending time in non-swing states. According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the canidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad.  As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.\\n\\nThe electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false.  As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitly creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winner-takes-all system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense.  Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashaimed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.\\n\\nWhen the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people.  In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated.  The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling  the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and dissapointment.  The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state.  This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed.  Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.                                 4         479      Does the electoral college work?

requirements and provide a score from 1 to 6 for each section.\\n\\n**Lead (Claim): 3**\\nThe lead is clear and concise in stating that the electoral college should be abolished. However, it lacks depth and nuance, relying heavily on emotional appeals rather than logical reasoning.\\n\\n**Position: 4**\\nThe student presents a clear argument against the electoral college, citing issues such as unfairness, lack of representation, and outdatedness. The use of quotes from Bradford Plummer's article adds credibility to the argument. However, the writing is often simplistic and lacks sophistication.\\n\\n**Counterclaim: 3**\\nThe counterargument presented by the student is limited and simplistic. While it attempts to address the notion that the electoral college prevents \"disaster\" (i.e., a candidate winning without popular support), it fails to engage with more substantial counterarguments or present a compelling rebuttal.\\n\\n**Rebuttal: 4**\\nThe rebuttal is somewhat effective in addressing the potential benefits of the electoral college, but it relies on emotional appeals rather than evidence-based reasoning. The student attempts to connect the founding fathers' intentions with modern-day consequences, which is an interesting argument but requires more development.\\n\\n**Evidence: 5**\\nThe use of quotes from Bradford Plummer's article adds credibility to the argument and provides valuable insights into the electoral college system. However, the student relies too heavily on a single source, neglecting to incorporate multiple perspectives or evidence-based data.\\n\\n**Concluding Summary: 4**\\nThe conclusion effectively summarizes the main points, but it falls short of providing a satisfying conclusion. The language is often simplistic, and the tone becomes overly emotional, detracting from the argument's impact.\\n\\n**Total Score: 27/30**\\n\\nPlease note that this score reflects my evaluation of the student's essay according to the assignment requirements. It does not account for grammatical or mechanical errors, which may be relevant in a real-world grading context.                    14.366984

                                                    I think the technology will work just fine in a class room. The reason i say that is becuase if someone feeling sad or down you can use the 3-D computer technology.`This technology really will help alot with clssrooms. This technology maybe make the world a better place. If you can tell how somebody is feeling with asking them you will know how to come off to that person.\\n\\nThe 3-D technology is so great. They read face experssions, modify test. They just know when you like something or you dont .The 3-D technology will be a huge step for the classrooms. It will help more and it really will take load off the teachers becuase if the students doesn't know will computer will teach them.\\n\\nIn the text it say's that if you make a bad face to a ad on the browser the ad will not be like the other one you didn't like. And if you simle at an ad the next one will be more simlar to the one you like. Its a good thing for your phone or PC to able to read your face experssion and can tell when you like something or when you don't. Another thing is if you work to hard or you don't understand, the 3-D can modify the test or work in other words it modify the work to the best way you can understand.\\n\\nI think they should the use the 3-D technology step. Only becuase i like the way it works. It helps with work, tell others how feeling, and helping the work that might need help with. The technology will make alot of useage in the school feild thatnthey are to prusite it in.                     3         285           Facial action coding system  Text dependent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

objectively:\\n\\n**Lead (1/2 point)**\\nThe lead is unclear and lacks a clear thesis statement. The student simply states their opinion without providing a specific argument.\\n\\nScore: 0\\n\\n**Position (2 points)**\\nThe position is weakly stated and lacks supporting evidence from the article. The student only provides vague statements about the benefits of the technology without concrete examples or analysis.\\n\\nScore: 1/2\\n\\n**Counterclaim (1 point)**\\nThere is no counterclaim presented in the essay, which is a crucial component of an argumentative essay.\\n\\nScore: 0\\n\\n**Rebuttal (2 points)**\\nThe rebuttal is absent from the essay, as there is no attempt to address potential criticisms or opposing viewpoints.\\n\\nScore: 0\\n\\n**Evidence (3 points)**\\nThe student relies heavily on personal opinions and lacks evidence from the article to support their claims. While they mention a few examples from the text, these are not effectively used to build an argument.\\n\\nScore: 1/2\\n\\n**Concluding Summary (2 points)**\\nThe concluding summary is brief and fails to provide a clear restatement of the main argument or reiterate the importance of using the technology in classrooms.\\n\\nScore: 0.5\\n\\nTotal Score: 3                     9.478117

activity, escpecially if it's worsening their grades.\\n\\nEvery one of the students get homework from almost every class, making free time after school more difficult to find. Having required time for other things for school will be too much and overwhelm many students, causing lower grades and higher stress. Some kids can't go to any afterschool extracurricular activity because of family problems, or their parents may not be able to bring them to where-ever they may need to go. If there are extracurricular activities going on during school time, some students may miss class work and be left behind, making more homework, making more stress and less sleep.\\n\\nSince every student is required to be in 'at least one extracurricular activity', then teachers will be overwhelmed as well. Teachers already have to get to school earlier than students do, and they have to work at home as well. Making their jobs harder with the same pay won't be helpful for anyone. Students could be spending their time more wisely than being forced to serve in student council. Teachers would have less time to work (or sleep) with now having to manage a new project for school.\\n\\nSetting up extracurricular activies requires work too, getting someone to set them up will take time and money, and it won't be worth it if no one wants to be a part of it. Student council doesn't seem useful or important in Middle school and sports shouldn't be required because some students could live too far away, or could be incapable of playing any games.\\n\\nHaving required extracurricular activities would simply make school more busy and may lower students grades. If it were up to the students to decide, it would be pretty clear what we would want.                                                                           3         325  Mandatory extracurricular activities     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

The student presents a clear position, but it's not a strong opening statement. They could have started with a more compelling argument or a thought-provoking question to grab the reader's attention. (0.5/1)\\n* **Position (1 point)**: The student clearly states their disagreement with the principal's decision. However, their reasons are mainly focused on the difficulties and challenges that extracurricular activities might pose, rather than presenting a strong case for why students should not participate in them. (0.8/1)\\n* **Counterclaim (1 point)**: The student does acknowledge potential benefits of extracurricular activities, but they only briefly mention it as an aside without fully addressing the counterargument. A more effective response would have provided a stronger argument against the benefits and engaged with possible counterpoints. (0.8/1)\\n* **Rebuttal (1 point)**: The student presents some evidence to support their position, such as the challenges of balancing homework and extracurricular activities. However, they fail to provide concrete data or examples that demonstrate the negative impact of required extracurricular activities on students' grades and stress levels. (0.8/1)\\n* **Evidence (1 point)**: The student mentions some potential drawbacks, but their evidence is largely anecdotal and speculative (\"Some kids can't go to any afterschool extracurricular activity because of family problems...\"). A more effective response would have included concrete data, research, or expert opinions to support their claims. (0.5/1)\\n* **Concluding Summary (1 point)**: The student summarizes their main points and reiterates their disagreement with the principal's decision. While it's clear what they're trying to say, the conclusion feels a bit abrupt and could have been more impactful with some additional reflection or call-to-action.

In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.\\n\\nStudents usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,\\n\\nBy letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.\\n\\nWhen teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.\\n\\nIt could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.\\n\\nThere is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.                     5         693                       Summer projects     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

breakdown of the score:\\n\\n* **Lead (1): 0.5** - The introduction is somewhat vague and doesn't clearly establish a position on the topic.\\n* **Position (2): 1.0** - The student takes a clear position in favor of student-designed summer projects, but the reasoning could be more developed.\\n* **Counterclaim (3): 0.8** - The student anticipates an opposing view and responds to it, but the counterargument is not fully addressed.\\n* **Rebuttal (4): 1.2** - The rebuttals are mostly effective in addressing potential concerns, with one notable exception where the response feels a bit forced (\"When a person cares about something they want it to be the best...\")\\n* **Evidence (5): 0.9** - There is some evidence provided to support the student's position, but it could be more substantial and varied.\\n* **Concluding Summary (6): 1.0** - The conclusion is clear and summarizes the main points effectively.\\n\\nOverall, the essay demonstrates a good understanding of the topic, but the writing could benefit from more clarity, depth, and evidence to support the claims made.                     9.328999

You don't only help people, but you also get a benefit of seeing amazing places. If you love animals you can take care of them. You get to have fun and know that you're doing something that helps others.\\n\\nLuke was just a small town boy and he got a great opportunity. First he had two part-time jobs at a grocery store and a bank. Luke was invited to be a Seagoing Cowboy by his friend Don. He accepted it and knew he was going to have a lifetime opportunity. Luke had a benefit of seeing Europe and China, saw the Acropolis in Greece, took a gondola ride in Venice, Italy, toured an excavated castle in Crete, and marveled at the Panama Canal on his way to China.\\n\\nThis job may be fun, but it still is a life changing experience. You see more than you could see just from home. You also know you're changing other people's lives. Luke may have had a wonderous adventure, but it also made him more aware of the needs in other countries.                     2         185         \"A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves\"  Text dependent                                                                                                                   You have just read the article, 'A Cowboy Who Rode the Waves.'

4\\n\\nExplanation: The student's response is missing several key elements of the assignment, including a clear introduction, body paragraphs with supporting evidence, and a conclusion that summarizes their argument. While the essay does provide some information about Luke's experiences as a Seagoing Cowboy, it lacks organization and structure, making it difficult to follow and understand the author's point of view. Additionally, there is no evidence provided to support the claim that participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program is a life-changing experience. Overall, while the essay does contain some positive aspects, such as the mention of Luke's adventures and the impact it had on him, it fails to meet the requirements of the assignment.                   4.384762                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Based on the assignment requirements, I would give the student's essay a score of:\\n\\n5\\n\\nThe strengths of the essay include:\\n\\n* The student has taken a clear position in favor of participating in the Seagoing Cowboys program.\\n* The introduction effectively introduces the main idea and provides a personal touch by mentioning Luke was just a small town boy.\\n* The body paragraphs provide some supporting details from the article, such as the places Luke visited.\\n* The essay attempts to address potential counterarguments (the \"This job may be fun\" sentence) and provide a rebuttal.\\n\\nHowever, there are areas for improvement:\\n\\n* The lead is quite general and could be more specific.\\n* The position statement could be more nuanced and detailed.\\n* The counterclaim is quite weak and doesn't fully engage with a potential opposing view.\\n* There is limited evidence to support the claims made in the essay. For example, while the student mentions several places Luke visited, there is no analysis of why these experiences were significant or how they demonstrate the value of participating in the program.\\n* The concluding summary could be more effective at summarizing the main points and reiterating the thesis statement.\\n\\nOverall, the essay demonstrates some understanding of the assignment requirements but requires further development to fully address the prompt.                     8.709489                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 5                     0.234190\n","22854  E272662CDFFC                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Long distance schooling is not a effective way of teaching students. It offers little benefits and raises a multitude of new issues to deal with. It could hinder the student learning process and leave them with a less then satisfactory education. It could also stifle the way in which young children and young adults develop important social skills which are needed in the modern world.\\n\\nMost students are lazy and tired of the same mundane routine of doing school work day in and day out. The only thing which keeps them on task is a teacher which is ever present helping them learn and grow, so what would happen if there was no teacher to monitor these students. The students would never accomplish anything meaningful, because they would have too many distractions all around them at home such as TV, video games, snacks, and many more enticing appliances and goods to steer their attention from that of education.\\n\\nStudents need teachers present to help them with their studies more than anything else in their learning career. A teacher over video or call could be less efficient and more irritated by the technology which could seriously hinder the student learning experience and the teachers ability to teach. Many older and more experienced teachers could find it hard to adapt to the new technology or outright refuse to use it out of frustration. This would restrict those students at home from getting the best possible education from the most experienced of teachers.\\n\\nStudents need a healthy and large dose of social interaction with other students to properly develop important social skills. Students need this sort of interaction and it plays a key role in not just their education, but their entire life. A long distance learning program could shut these particular students off from the rest of society causing many unseen mental and physical effects. These students would then be unprepared fof the challenges ahead in life and leave them at a disadvantage when compared to other students.\\n\\nWhat about students with disabilities? Wouldnt it be easier for both the school system and the student with the disability to just stay at home? Most school systems already have a well organized and defined public transportation system to take them to school and many schools already offer specialized classes and programs specifically for these less gifted students. What if the student is sick or wants to stay at home? Schools already are integrated well enough into the internet that teachers can give them assignments and classwork while they are at home sick and if a students wants to work from home there is always the option of home schooling and private tutors.\\n\\nIn the end, most students are better off just going to school and learning under the guidance of physical teachers and interacting with other students in the school environment. Long distance learning programs offer more issues than benefits and would stifle the way in which students learn and grow in many different ways. This is why long distance learning programs are not a viable alternative to traditional schools.                     5         504                     Distance learning     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

                                   **Total Score: 4**\\n\\nHere's the breakdown of the score for each section:\\n\\n* **Lead:** The student clearly states their position, but it's a bit too simplistic and doesn't provide a strong thesis statement. (1/2)\\n* **Position:** The student presents a clear argument against distance learning, but it lacks depth and nuance. They fail to consider potential benefits or counterarguments. (1.5/3)\\n* **Counterclaim:** The student attempts to address potential concerns about students with disabilities, but their response is dismissive and doesn't fully engage with the issue. (2/3)\\n* **Rebuttal:** The student's rebuttals are mostly based on assumptions about students' behavior and motivations, rather than evidence or logical reasoning. They fail to provide convincing counterarguments against distance learning. (1.5/3)\\n* **Evidence:** The student relies heavily on hypothetical scenarios and general statements, but provides little concrete evidence to support their claims. (1/2)\\n* **Concluding Summary:** The student summarizes their position effectively, but it's not a strong conclusion that ties together the main points of their essay. (1.5/3)\\n\\nOverall, the student's response is lacking in several areas, including depth of argument, consideration of counterarguments, and use of evidence to support claims. However, they do demonstrate some understanding of the topic and are able to present a clear position.                    10.490935

Some , well many, that we do not even know about. Now many believe the face on Mars was created my aliens. But, how could it be so? Well, because it was not.\\n\\nFirst of all how could have the aliens created an artifact. How they create it as a form of a face. It's not like aliens just have tools laying around and they sculpt when they are bored. It started to form over the years. The way it was forming and the shadows around it just made it look more of a face.\\n\\nWith all honesty do you not think if NASA was 100% sure this \"face\" was created by aliens they would've announced it? That would have been big proof that aliens do exist. After all scientists have been trying to look for any other life on other planets for over the years. So that just says NASA also sees it as just a natrual landform.\\n\\nThe face on Mars is became very popular. But not in the scientist type way. It has become a pop icon. It has starred in a Hollywood film,appeared in books, magazines,radio talk shows, even haunted grocery store checkout likes for 25 years. Peopl seem to find it interesting since they are talking and mentioning it alot. I am thinking they just seem to find it interesting that aliens might have created it.\\n\\nI think it is safe to say that the face on Mars is just a natrual landform. NASA thinks that, so maybe we shoud too. After all they are scientist and part of NASA that knows all this. Later on I know that they will fnd other thing more evidence. People might have something new to believe.                                               3         317                      The Face on Mars  Text dependent                                                                                                         You have read the article 'Unmasking the Face on Mars.'

Our principle has decided that it is mandatory for all students to participate in at least one extracurricular activity. Some kids might like the idea of playing a sport or joining yearbook club because they have a lot of free time or they like participating in extracurricular activities. But others might feel like they are already to busy after school with homework taking up their free time or they might want to use their free time to relax and reset themselves for the next day. If students were required to do at least one extracurricular activity then some students would not have time to do homework, students might not be passionate about participating in any of the extracurricular activities offered, and they would not be able to take a break from the stressful school atmosphere.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities can take up a lot of time which means less time for students to do homework. Sports can be two to four hours long everyday after school making it so students are forced to do their homework late in the night when they really should be in bed asleep preparing their brains for the next day of work. Some extracurricular activities like band require students to participate in concerts which end late at night giving students no time to do their homework at all. Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.\\n\\nSome students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.                     5         708  Mandatory extracurricular activities     Independent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

demonstrates a clear stance against mandatory extracurricular activities, with some well-supported arguments and examples. Here's a breakdown of the strengths and weaknesses:\\n\\n* **Lead**: The introduction sets up the debate effectively, but it could be more concise and focused on the main argument.\\n* **Position**: The student clearly states their opposition to mandatory extracurricular activities, citing reasons such as lack of time for homework and differing interests among students.\\n* **Counterclaim**: The essay anticipates potential counterarguments, acknowledging that some students might benefit from extracurricular activities. However, the response could be more comprehensive in addressing these opposing views.\\n* **Rebuttal**: The student effectively refutes the idea that extracurricular activities are beneficial by highlighting the negative consequences of requiring participation, such as decreased homework time and reduced academic performance.\\n* **Evidence**: The essay provides some examples to support the arguments, but they could be more detailed and specific. For instance, the sports example is limited to a two- to four-hour commitment each day, which might not accurately represent all extracurricular activities.\\n* **Concluding Summary**: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and reiterates the student's position against mandatory extracurricular activities.\\n\\nOverall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the assignment requirements and presents some strong arguments.

I know that they may have stuff to do with friends, but school activities come before social life. Community service is helpful for our city. It can help in many ways, for example putting an ad in the newspaper for cleaning houses.\\n\\nThe principal is the boss of the school and could make up his own rules when he or she feels is needed. Even if the principal cannot make the students do community service, she can at least do a school speech about how our city needs to be clean.\\n\\nMaybe the principal could bribe the students with a prize for the school if they all do community service. For instance, they could all go to a amusement park at the end of the year. The point is, wouldn't you want to have a clean environment and want to be able to breath in fresh air. Community service is not a punishment, it is a healthy way make our society clean.\\n\\nAfter you have served the community service you will have enough time to do what have had planned. I would understand if you played sports for the school and had a team practice, but other than that you should be there. The principal should put a law that if you don't attend community service you don't go to this school.                           2         241                     Community service     Independent                                                  Some of your friends perform community service. For example, some tutor elementary school children and others clean up litter. They think helping the community is very important. But other friends of yours think community service takes too much time away from what they need or want to do. \\nYour principal is deciding whether to require all students to perform community service. \\nWrite a letter to your principal in which you take a position on whether students should be required to perform community service. Support your position with examples.

community service and provides some examples to support their argument. They also acknowledge that the principal has the authority to make rules and suggest a possible incentive for students to participate. However, the essay lacks a strong counterargument or rebuttal, and there is no evidentiary support to back up the claims made. Additionally, the conclusion does not effectively summarize the main points of the essay.                   3.324041                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        **Total Score: 3**\\n\\nI will evaluate the response based on the Lead, Position, Counterclaim, Rebuttal, Evidence, and Concluding Summary.\\n\\n* **Lead (0/1)**: The introduction lacks clarity and fails to effectively present the writer's position. It simply states an opinion without providing any supporting context or clear direction.\\n* **Position (2/3)**: The writer presents a clear position on requiring community service, but it is not well-supported by logical reasoning or evidence. The statement that \"school activities come before social life\" is a vague assertion that does not provide strong justification for the requirement.\\n* **Counterclaim (1/2)**: The writer briefly acknowledges potential counterarguments from students who might be opposed to community service, but fails to provide any substantial responses or rebuttals.\\n* **Rebuttal (0/2)**: There is no meaningful attempt to address potential counterarguments, and the text simply reiterates the writer's original position without addressing any concerns or criticisms.\\n* **Evidence (1/3)**: The only evidence presented is a vague example about putting an ad in the newspaper for cleaning houses. This example does not effectively demonstrate the value of community service or its relevance to the topic.\\n* **Concluding Summary (0/2)**: The conclusion is weak and lacks clarity, failing to summarize the writer's main points or provide any final thoughts on the importance of community service.\\n\\nOverall, while the writer presents a clear position, they fail to adequately support it with evidence, address counterarguments, or effectively conclude their argument.                    10.995595

 Dear Senator,\\n\\nIn all honestly, getting rid of the Electoral College is for the best. It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people.\\n\\nSource 2 states that the Electoral college is unfair for the voters because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad.\\n\\nIn the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business.\\n\\nVoters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want.\\n\\nArticle 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.\\n\\nDoing away with the Electoral Cololege is the best thing to do for the people. IT's unfair and tricky. The people deserve to be respected and not cheated out of their vote by electors.                           3         315      Does the electoral college work?  Text dependent  Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States. Use the information from the texts in your essay. Manage your time carefully so that you can read the passages; plan your response; write your response; and revise and edit your response. Be sure to include a claim; address counterclaims; use evidence from multiple sources; and avoid overly relying on one source. Your response should be in the form of a multiparagraph essay. Write your response in the space provided.  Source 1: \"What is the Electoral College?\", by the Office of the Federal Register \\n Source 2: \"The Indefensible Electoral College: Why even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong,\" by Bradford Plumer \\n Source 3: \"In Defense of the Electoral College: Five reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President,\" by Judge Richard A. Posner      F          9.0         No          Black/African American                             NaN                                  NaN                102.0              315.0  4\\n\\nThe student's answer shows an understanding of key points related to both sides of the debate surrounding the Electoral College and its potential replacement with a popular vote system for presidential elections. The essay begins with a clear claim supporting the maintenance of the Electoral College, emphasizing that it is \"for the best\" because it is \"unfair to voters.\" However, the main argument shifts towards advocating for change by asserting that the Electoral College can be replaced by election through popular vote without stating or fully addressing the original claim.\\n\\nThe essay effectively uses two sources, integrating them into the discussion of the Electoral College's disadvantages. It cites information about candidates focusing only on swing states during elections and mentions instances where voters in certain regions do not receive visits from presidential campaigns or campaign advertisements. The student also discusses the lack of direct control voters have over electors' decisions.\\n\\nHowever, the essay could benefit from more explicit reference to both sides of the argument, which is particularly weak since it transitions away from supporting the Electoral College mid-way through without a clear rebuttal addressing potential counterarguments against its abolition or modification. The student acknowledges concerns about electors potentially voting contrary to their state's preference but does not fully address this issue.\\n\\nA stronger essay would have balanced the arguments more effectively, critiquing both sides and then presenting a well-reasoned conclusion that supports or refines the position being argued for. In addition, while there is some mention of how the Electoral College works as per Article 1 of the Constitution, this explanation could be expanded upon to provide more context and support for the argument.\\n\\nOverall, the essay demonstrates an adequate grasp of the issue at hand but lacks a cohesive structure that maintains focus on its initial claim. The final grade reflects these aspects, indicating that while there are some strengths in addressing key points and using sources effectively, there is room for improvement in argument coherence and balance.                 10.014778  3 (Average)\\n\\nLead: The student began with a clear claim, but it could have been more forceful and engaging to grab the reader's attention.\\nPosition: The student presented their position effectively, using relevant information from source 2 to argue against the Electoral College. However, some details about the benefits of popular vote were missing.\\nCounterclaim: The student acknowledged potential counterarguments in the form of a question and briefly addressed them by stating that electors might not always align with the people's choice. This response could have been more comprehensive in addressing counterclaims.\\nEvidence: The student provided evidence from source 2 to support their position, but they missed opportunities to use other sources for additional evidence or perspectives.\\nRebuttal: The student could have presented a stronger rebuttal by providing further explanation as to why the potential issues with popular vote are not significant and outweighed by its benefits.\\nConcluding Summary: The student provided a clear conclusion, but it lacked a strong call-to-action or final thoughts to leave a lasting impression on the reader.\\nOverall, the essay is well-structured and presents a clear argument, but there are opportunities for improvement in terms of strengthening the position, addressing counterclaims more comprehensively, using multiple sources, and crafting a more impactful conclusion.                 7.655927            3 \\n                   0.316100                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \\nScore: 3/6\\n\\nThe essay lacks a clear and concise claim, making it difficult to understand the writer's stance on the topic. While the writer does provide some evidence from sources, they do not effectively integrate this evidence into their argument or address counterarguments presented in the prompt.

Who did you go to for advice? Making decisions can prove to be very difficult sometimes. Everybody has been in at least one situation where they have to make a very important decision. Many seek advice from multiple other people in order to make the best decision possible. That is the best way to get advice. If someone has gone to multiple people for advice, then the decision they were trying to make was most likely a smart one. Going to multiple people for advice can really help somebody make a logical decision that will benefit them in the future. Seeking advice from more than one person helps people make good decisions because of the information learned from their experiences, their different perspectives on certain issues or ideas, and because it has been proven to help people make smart decisions.\\n\\nFirstly, seeking advice from multiple people leads to great decisions because each person that gives advice will give advice based on their own personal experiences. Assuming that they are of appropriate age, each person that gives advice will have had various work experiences and can offer advice based on those experiences. For example, when in the process of making a decision about whether or not to accept an offer to a job, those pieces of advice from those people can positively impact the decision. Additionally, the people that give advice have usually met a lot of other people and have experience with dealing with them. This is extremely important because advice can be given based on who to avoid and who to talk to. Also, the people who are giving the advice can give details about what has gone wrong at various points in their life. Multiple pieces of information about accidents happening can help keep anyone safe from those vary same situations. The first reason why getting advice from multiple other people can lead to beneficial decisions is because the advice is based on multiple experiences from those people's lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, getting advice from multiple others helps lead to very smart decisions because they can offer wise advice based on their different perspectives. Everyone has been or is being raised differently and has slightly different views on certain issues and topics. When seeking advice from others, it is extremely helpful to be able to learn about the various perspectives of the people giving advice that were built during childhood. Also, other people may have influenced how the people giving advice view things. This means that the advice that is being given is not merely based on the people who are giving advice, but more people who you may not be able to talk to. The people giving advice may also have had teachers, mentors, or professors who have taught them how to view things differently. For example, someone who is seeking advice about which college they should attend might seek advice from people who have been through the process before, because they can offer views on college admission that others may not. The second reason why getting advice from multiple people leads to great decisions and success is because the person seeking advice can be offered a plethora of different perspectives.\\n\\nLastly, I have witnessed what incredible benefits seeking advice from multiple others has on someone. About one year ago, my brother, Generic_name was just beginning the college application process. He figured out which schools he was going to apply to and he applied to them. He got into five schools, but was torn between his top three schools. Generic_name went to our parents, his old teachers, school counselors, and even coaches for advice. He took notes every time he met with someone and kept it all in a notebook. After about four months, he ended up with a notebook full of advice, stories, opinions, and conversations from all those people that he talked to about college. After reading the notebook, he had pretty much already narrowed it down to one college. Generic_name could not have come to a smart, swift decision if it were not for the many people who gave him their advice. The advice he collected was so incredibly helpful because it was based on the very experiences and perspectives of the people who gave it to him. Had he only been offered advice from one person, he would have made a biased decision that may not have been right for him. Now my brother is attending a great school and is as happy as can be. This just goes to show that going to multiple people for advice is tremendously helpful and has a massive positive impact on the person or people trying to make a decision.\\n\\nSeeking advice from multiple others is one of the best ways to gather extremely helpful insight that will help you make a smart, well thought out decision that will bring great benefits in the future. Firstly, it lets you learn about real experiences that have happened in other people's lives. Next, it helps you see the issue or topic from other interesting, wise perspectives. Lastly, I and many others have witnessed the amazing benefits that it has on people. If you are ever faced with a tough decision, go to multiple people for advice. I am sure that the advice they will give you will be helpful, as it will most likely be based off of experiences and different perspectives. If someone ever comes to you for advice, give them advice that will truly help them and lead them to make a great decision. They will remember and appreciate you for how much you helped them.</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>958</td>\n","      <td>Seeking multiple opinions</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>When people ask for advice, they sometimes talk to more than one person.

Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venu's atmosphere.\" That is a description of the air and sky of Venus, now I will give a description of the surface of Venus. \"On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmospheric pressure is 90 time greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Those are some harsh conditions. The author seems to be with the idea of exploring Venus. There are some very interesting things that the author brings up such as \"a vehicle hovering over Venus would avoid the unfriendly ground conditions by staying up and out of their way.\" this seems to prove that it could be possible but what about power, the temperature, and air pressure well the author also included that. \"At thirty-plus miles above the surface, the temperatures would still be toasty at around 170 degrees farenheit, but the air pressure would be close to that of sea level on Earth. Solar power would be plentiful.\" So then what about the danger of radiation well it turns out that that is also brought up. \"Radiation would not exceed Earth levels. Not easy conditions, but survivable for humans.\" so that explains almost all the troubles of this trip and exploration, but there won't be much to see through all the clouds and the fact that going to the ground is too dangerous what could you possibly do. The author seems to support the idea of studying Venus really well, but I don't think that we know enough about the planet to determine whether going is in our best interest.</td>\n","      <td>3</td>\n","      <td>337</td>\n","      <td>Exploring Venus</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Venus is the same as the Earth, I mean it is reffered to as Earth's \"twin\", but there both the same only because of the density and size. Both planets do have the same shape and density, but planet Earth is much more safer than Venus.\\n\\nVenus has a thick atmoshpere, so it makes it harder to breathe. For example, in the text it says,\" a thick atmosphere of almost 97 percent carbon dioxide blankets Venus. Even more challenging are the clouds of highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere.\" It's impossible for somoene to even live on Venus because of it's own atmosphere.\\n\\nExploring and studying the planet Venus is actually challenging when you think about it. People tried to study about the planet, people have tried to explore, but in the end, it ends up failing. For example, in the text it states, \" since no spacecraft survived the landing for more than a few hours. Maybe this issue explains why not a single spaceship has touched down on Venus in more than three decades. Numerous factors contribute to Venus's reputation as a challenging planet for humans to study, despite its proximity to us.\" This is explaining how bad the planet really is.\\n\\nNo spacecraft can even touch the ground on planet Venus. The reason why no spacecraft has touched down on planet Venus is because of the clouds itself. For example, in the text it explains,\" the clouds are highly corrosive sulfuric acid in Venus's atmosphere. On the planet's surface, temperatures average over 800 degrees Fahrenheit, and the atmoshpheric pressure is 90 times greater than what we experience on our own planet.\" Venus has a temperature of 800 degrees fahrenheit, while Earth's highest temperature is at least 110 to 120 degrees. So planet Venus is very hot, that probably explains why no spacecraft can land on the planet because it's so hot in the planet that the clouds trap all that heat inside.\\n\\nIn conclusion, these are the reasons why the author suggests that studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.</td>\n","      <td>2</td>\n","      <td>368</td>\n","      <td>Exploring Venus</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Children tend to not want to say much or tell the teachers how they really feel about a homework assignment or how boring their class really is. With the new technology called the Facial Action Coding System teachers and administrators can view how the students really feel about the way things are devised. This technology can perceive and recognize the subtle facial movements of humans based off a still image of the person. The Facial Action Coding System could be valuable to read students' emotional expresions in the classroom and help schools become more sufficient.\\n\\nIn the article the author says \"if you smile when a Web ad appears on your screen, a similar ad might follow.\" Some type of software is seeing what one takes interest in and making it a priority to stay consistent. School could be the same way. If the Facial Action Coding System sees that during a specific activity or certain topic students are engaged and very pleased with the task, it could help the school follow up with those types of tasks more often. The author quotes Dr. Hang by saying \"a classroom computer could recognize when a student is becoming confused or bored.\" What Dr. Hang is initially saying is, if the computers have the asset of detecting if students are confused or having trouble the new technology could transfer that to teachers. He also says \" Then it could modify the lesson, like an effective human intstructor.\" Sometimes students have trouble asking the teacher for assistance. Or some things just may be too hard for them, but they will never say anything. With the help of the Facial Action Coding System, lessons can change to where as it approaches each student differently. This could possibly provide a boost to essential test scores for a school. However, not to say that the software could potentially read the emotions of others wrong, because in some cases humans tend to have a look on their face that contradicts their actual emotion. Not to mention the software is compared against a neutral face. That means that the software is going off of a blank expression extracting a emotion from it. But, that's what makes the Facial Action Coding System so unique and valuable because students often have blank expressions protrayed on their face anyhow.\\n\\nAll in all, the Facial Action Coding System could be a great value to assist instructors in reading students emotions in the classroom. Not only could it give a stepping stone to major test scores, but it could assist school becoming students best interest.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>483</td>\n","      <td>Facial action coding system</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In the article \"Making Mona Lisa Smile,\" the author describes how a new technology called the Facial Action Coding System enables computers to identify human emotions.

According to the article\\n\\n\"What Is the Electoral College\"\\n\\nby the Office of the Federal Register, \"The Electoral College process consists of the selection of th electors, the meeting of the electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of the electoral votes by Congress.\" Basically we vote for our electors which then they vote for the President which seem to be working just fine why change it?\\n\\nThere are many resons why people are in favor of changing the Electoral College for popular vote. In the article\\n\\n\"Why  even the best-laid defenses of the system are wrong\"\\n\\nby Bradford Plumer he asks \"Can voters  control whom their electors vote for?\" Then answers himself with \"Not always.\" This may be true but voters do get to vote for thier electors and it is the voters job to vote for the one they believe will choose the right president. The people need to put faith in thier electors, and even if the Electoral College was changed to popular vote they would have to vote for the president and put faith in him or her to make the right decisions for them, is they same basic thing but having electors are just another step.\\n\\n\"The Electoral College restores some of the weight in the political balance that large states (by population) lose by virtue of the mal-apportionment of the Senate decreed in the Constitution\" This was stated in the article \"\\n\\nFive reasons to keep our despised method of choosing the President\"\\n\\nby Richard A. Posner. This is a very good point he made, the larger states get more attention than the smaller states when it comes to  popular voting in presidental elections because they have a much larger population giving them more votes.\\n\\nWhen it comes to popular voting there have been times where no canidate has a mojority cast of votes and the Electoral College Prevents that problem. In  1968 Nixon received 43 percent pluraltiy or more votes than the other canidates but still not receving a clear majority of votes in the popular votes same with Clinton in 1992 but they both won majority in the Electroral College, so there was no need for and run-off election.\\n\\nI believe that we shouldn't change the Electoral College for popular votes the way we arevoting now is working just fine and it makes it so larger states like Texas don't get more of an impact on the election because of thier population than smaller states like Rhode Island. Also the Electoral College prevents Run-off elections.

This act of using the Electoral College is, by definition, not democratic. Didn't our founding fathers create this country promising democracy and people representation? They did, and that is why the Electoral College must crumble. Florida State Senator, we need to change how our country votes on its leader; we need to use popular vote for the president of the United States because this method is more democratic, the people representing the  Electoral College are flawed humans, and the nature of this type of election forces some states to be ignored. Florida State Senator, you must take action against the flawed Electoral College!\\n\\nBecause of the function of the Electoral College, the people aren't truly represented for. According to Source 2, the voters--the ones supposedly voting for our new president--vote for a group of electors instead. Due to the power of the Electoral Colleg, electors can vote for any candidate. This process we have every 4 years is truly un-democratic. For example, during the 2000 election, Al Gore was the candidate with the most popular votes--this meant that the majority of the citizens of the U.S. wants him to be president. However, Al Gore lost since the majority of electors from the Electoral College voted him. Lastly, in the case of a time, the lection will truly be un-democratic; the House of Representatives will have to choose the new president. The people may allow continued usage of the imperfect Electoral College, but there is still one major problem: the Electoral College is made up of flawed, easily manipulated humans.\\n\\nAccording to Source 1, the electors are made up of people chosen by the candidate's political party. Immediately, these electors can easily decide on the candidate to vote on; it's just the matter of the amount of electors each candidate has. Also, the electors are human beings, and everyone knows that humans are flawed creatures. According to Source 2, electors have been replaced to be against the opposing candidate or wait until the last minute to vote. Although, according to Source 3, the electors are chosen and are given trust, others can still influence them. Candidates or even political parties can influence the electors to vote for their chosen person. Lastly, Florida State Senator, the nature of the Electoral College forces some states to be ignored.\\n\\nFlorida State Senator, as you may know, the candidate for presidency usually go to the \"swing\" states to win \"the people's\" vote. People, however, from the non-swing states are generally ignored. During the 2000 election, 17 states weren't even able to see a candidate they are voting for the title of president. Although it is understandable that candidates go to the \"swing\" and populous states, there is no excuse for ignoring thousands of people from the small states. The president of the United States is the president for an entire country, not just a region of it. Voters from the non-swing states will still want to see the candidate to decide on who to vote for, even though they aren't voting for the actual candidate. The Electoral College is imperfect and un-democratic!\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Electoral College and its electors must be disbanded so that popular vote will be used in determining the new president of the United States. According to both Source 2 and 3, the process of voting a group of people to vote for you is un-democratic. Electors, the people making up th Electoral College, can be manipulated and coerced into voting a specific candidate. Lastly, non-swing states will be ignored; this will anger and frustrate them since not one candidate tried to persuade them. Florida State Senator, you must, in the best of your ability and then some, try to topple down the un-democratic roots of the Electoral College. The people, the ones who must truly decide on the president, will be immensely greatful towards you; in a 2000 poll, 60% of the voters even stated that they want a popular-vote type of election. Florida State Senator, I implore to you, abolish the Electoral College in the same manner as with slavery.

But, Venus is a very dangerous place. It is very hot, and it has very strong winds. It is also mostly Carbon Dioxide, which is deadly to humans if too much of it is inhaled. But, despite all of that, the author believes it is worth a chance giving it a deeper look.\\n\\nIt was said earlier on in the article that no space probe has landed on venus in nearly three decades. We got close, we explored the outside of venus to get a good look at it's yellow color, but its been awhile since we struck ground on the deadly planet. They say that Venus is Earth-like. For example, it is said that Venus is home to craters, valleys, mountains, etc.. Just like here on Earth. The Grand Canyon, Death Valley, Mount Everest, Mount Fuji, are all examples of what we have on Earth that could be similar to what is on Venus. If Venus is as hot as it is, there are probably volcanoes located somewhere on Venus, if not all over.\\n\\nWhich brings back the point that the author believes that it is worth studying Venus depsite the dangers. We would never know for sure what is on Venus if it goes without studying. The Earth-like structure is more or less a belief. Plus, if no probe has landed on the surface of Venus in three decades, then Venus could've changed massively and we wouldn't know how much of a change it has because we can't land on Venus. It isn't our fault that we can't land though, as Venus' clouds are very thick. The atmosphere itself is very thick on Venus, which makes it harder for exploration to occur. It was said probes can't last for more than a few hours.\\n\\nThe point is, if we can't explore Venus we may not truly know what lies beneath the clouds. The author believes that the exploration of Venus is worth pursuing even though it is dangerous. They believe that we should explore Venus. In paragraph 8, the author says, \"Our travels on Earth and beyond should not be limited by dangers and doubts but should be expanded to meet the very edges of imagination and innovation.\" That is a powerful quote. It shows that we, as humans should not let fears get in the way of exploring to open up our imagination. The author is syaing that we shouldn't not explore Venus because of the dangers, but that we should continue exploring. We shouldn't let dangers and doubts limit our exploration. Our travels should instead be expanded because of imagination. Imagination goes a long way, and if we can get past these dangers, and explore Venus, then we can get to the edge of imagination. But, we can extend that imagination, and take exploration further. This goes not only for the exploration of Venus, but for any person in general. Don't let dangers and doubts stop you from seeing your imagination through, in some cirumstances. If it is very dangerous then it's not safe, but in a situation like this, we go unmanned.\\n\\nAnd so, we should explore Venus. The author thinks that explortion is a worthy pursui despite the dangers because of imagination and innovation.\\n\\nIn conclusion, Venus is, well hard to explore due to the dangers it presents. Thick atmosphere made almost entirely of carbon Dioxide. Storms and strong winds. Extreme heat. However, the author believes that we shouldn't let those dangers stop us. We shouldn't let the dangers of Venus stop our exploration forever. Instead, the author thinks that we should instead be powered by imagination and innovation to explore Venus. Let our ideas and our minds take us into a world we have yet to uncover. We have uncovered some of Venus, but not much. It has been 30 years since we landed an unmanned spacecraft on Venus. The author thinks that we should let our ideas fuel the engine that explores Venus. And uncover some of its secrets that were hiding from us all along.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>682</td>\n","      <td>Exploring Venus</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>In \"The Challenge of Exploring Venus,\" the author suggests studying Venus is a worthy pursuit despite the dangers it presents.

Therefore scientist's have also found that when the person gets other peoples opinions, that the person normally chooses the better opinion and makes the better choice. Also when you get other people's opinions you get more and more knowledge about the choice that you are about to make. Another thing is when the person gives you their opinion don't deny their opinion, you need to listen to what they have to say and don't just ignore them.\\n\\nSecondly, you should never let someone encourage you to make a choice, but you should let someone tell you their opinion that away you know what you might like and want you don't like. For example say that your going out and looking for a job you might ask your friends that worked at one of the jobs that you are looking at, and they might tell you their opinion about the job. So then you can go and research about the job and see if you like it or not, then now you are ready for the job and you now know what to kinda expect.\\n\\nFurthermore, sometimes it might be good to ask your friends for their opinion on things, but other times it might not be the best time. Like say that you want to go to a football game with one of your friends, but your friend doesnt like the football teams that you are going to watch so that might not be a good time to ask for your friends opinion. So some of the time you might have to make your own choice and you might not be able to ask for your friends opinion.\\n\\nLastly, honestly when your making like a major decision in your life, I would honestly use your gut to make the choice instead of asking for your friends opinion. Then other times when it's not such a major decison then I would maybe ask your friends.

According to Bradford Plummer, in the 2000 campaign seventeen states did not even see the canidates at all and 25 percent of the largest media markets did not even see a single campaign ad.  As previously proven, the electoral college must be abolished due to the unfairness of its system.\\n\\nThe electoral college believers say that the electoral college stops disaster from happening, this is false.  As Americans vote they vote for a slate of electors, which definitly creates a loss of the opposing or minority votes. This is because of the winner-takes-all system that the electoral college runs off of. When the majority of the votes is accounted for, the minority votes are basically thrown away in a sense.  Also, the electoral college ruins the chance of a more correct voting experience for old and new voters, making Americans ashaimed and unwilling to vote because of the feeling of their vote meaning nothing or perhaps being crippled by the electoral college.\\n\\nWhen the founding fathers of America created the electoral college it was an age without technology, making the electoral college a grand idea. Long ago, the electoral college served a patriotic and noble purpose as their was no technology and much less people.  In todays age of technology, the record keeping and election process could not get any better as long as the electoral college is abolished and never reincarnated.  The electoral college abolishes individual votes for the majority, crippling  the American voting experience and smuthering it in shame and dissapointment.  The electoral college is outdated in many ways and should be dismissed from America.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the electoral college is shaming Americans from every state.  This system should be permanantly abolished becuase of its lack of fairness and reliability. Every American vote should count just as much as its opposing vote instead of being dismissed.  Free the vote and let the electoral college be forever dismissed of its dutys.</td>\n","      <td>4</td>\n","      <td>479</td>\n","      <td>Does the electoral college work?</td>\n","      <td>Text dependent</td>\n","      <td>Write a letter to your state senator in which you argue in favor of keeping the Electoral College or changing to election by popular vote for the president of the United States.

Some kids can't go to any afterschool extracurricular activity because of family problems, or their parents may not be able to bring them to where-ever they may need to go. If there are extracurricular activities going on during school time, some students may miss class work and be left behind, making more homework, making more stress and less sleep.\\n\\nSince every student is required to be in 'at least one extracurricular activity', then teachers will be overwhelmed as well. Teachers already have to get to school earlier than students do, and they have to work at home as well. Making their jobs harder with the same pay won't be helpful for anyone. Students could be spending their time more wisely than being forced to serve in student council.

In schools students arent given the opportunity to be as creative as they could be because of how restrictive and bland the projects and assignments made by teachers are. If our society depends on the creativity and skill set of the current generation in schools why not give them the opportunity to develop their skills and be able to flourish in their own success? Which is why I think that summer projects should be student designed because its helps students learn to become more creative and helps prepare them for the future.\\n\\nStudents usually spend their summer either sleeping or just having fun with their friends trying to make the most out of the break but as students reach high schools they find that they have to do projects over the summer. Almost all students are annoyed at the fact that they have to do a summer project for a class and most of them leave it till the last second to actually do it. If students were allowed to design these projects themselves it would give them the will and incentive to do it because they would have designed it in a way that it would seem interesting to them. It would help break away from their habit of carelessly doing it and having them get creative with their project and make something astonishing,\\n\\nBy letting students design their own projects to do over the summer it also helps them develop real life skills that they can use in the workplace. Students dont tend to learn anything new over the summer since they are focused on their break and enjoying it as much as possible but doing a project that takes time and interests them helps them learn what goes into making a project and what the requirements are. This helps students to use their new found abilities in the workplace to much more easily express their creativity since they now know the tools to show it.\\n\\nWhen teachers make summer projects for students it makes it harder for a student to care about the project because they didnt really have a part in making it, so if the teachers decide on making a project based on a topic a student doesnt like they wouldnt be as interested. It would lead to them wanting to do the bear minimum and be done with it, never even inspiring them use their creativity. Which is why when a student makes their own project they can be more creative and choose a topic or idea that interests them related to the class doing their best effort to portray how much they care about it.\\n\\nIt could be argued that if students made their own projects they would make it easy that it wouldnt take any time for them to finish it. Although some students would just want to be done with their project and do something easy most students would want to use this project as an opportunity to get their point and ideas across. When a person cares about something they want it to be the best , so when a student designs a project in which they care about they would obviously want to do their best since they put so much work into it. So saying that a student wouldnt care about a project they created would be wrong since even if they did design a bad project they would be the one doing it and would make it much harder for themselves.\\n\\nThere is so much good that can come out of letting students design their own projects not only for them but for their future as well. If teachers give students the opportunity to design their own project then they would be teaching more than the class but skills they can use in the future as well. Since creativity is the backbone of everything in the world when teachers start to make new ideas to have students think more creatively it helps the development of new ideas and innovations in the future.</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>693</td>\n","      <td>Summer projects</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

It offers little benefits and raises a multitude of new issues to deal with. It could hinder the student learning process and leave them with a less then satisfactory education. It could also stifle the way in which young children and young adults develop important social skills which are needed in the modern world.\\n\\nMost students are lazy and tired of the same mundane routine of doing school work day in and day out. The only thing which keeps them on task is a teacher which is ever present helping them learn and grow, so what would happen if there was no teacher to monitor these students. The students would never accomplish anything meaningful, because they would have too many distractions all around them at home such as TV, video games, snacks, and many more enticing appliances and goods to steer their attention from that of education.\\n\\nStudents need teachers present to help them with their studies more than anything else in their learning career. A teacher over video or call could be less efficient and more irritated by the technology which could seriously hinder the student learning experience and the teachers ability to teach. Many older and more experienced teachers could find it hard to adapt to the new technology or outright refuse to use it out of frustration. This would restrict those students at home from getting the best possible education from the most experienced of teachers.\\n\\nStudents need a healthy and large dose of social interaction with other students to properly develop important social skills. Students need this sort of interaction and it plays a key role in not just their education, but their entire life. A long distance learning program could shut these particular students off from the rest of society causing many unseen mental and physical effects. These students would then be unprepared fof the challenges ahead in life and leave them at a disadvantage when compared to other students.\\n\\nWhat about students with disabilities? Wouldnt it be easier for both the school system and the student with the disability to just stay at home? Most school systems already have a well organized and defined public transportation system to take them to school and many schools already offer specialized classes and programs specifically for these less gifted students. What if the student is sick or wants to stay at home? Schools already are integrated well enough into the internet that teachers can give them assignments and classwork while they are at home sick and if a students wants to work from home there is always the option of home schooling and private tutors.\\n\\nIn the end, most students are better off just going to school and learning under the guidance of physical teachers and interacting with other students in the school environment. Long distance learning programs offer more issues than benefits and would stifle the way in which students learn and grow in many different ways.

Other kids might take longer to do homework because they like to take their time or they are struggling in their school subjects. If those students were forced to do an extracurricular activity their grades might drop dramatically because they don't have the amount of time they need to do their homework after school. If extracurricular activities were required then students would not have any time to do their homework.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities are fun for some, but not for all. Some students might want to join the football team or organize pep rallies, but others might not to want to do anything school related that they don't have to do. Extracurricular's like yearbook club require a lot of focus and passion for the amount of effort it takes. I doubt that the person running an extracurricular activity would want a student participating in their club that doesn't want to put forth any effort in what they are doing. If students are not passionate about the extracurricular activity they are taking, then they are just wasting the time of the people that are actually putting effort into the activity. Students should not be required to take an extracurricular activity because it takes effort that some students are not willing to give.\\n\\nSome students might feel that extracurricular activities relieve their stress and allow them to relax, but other students feel the complete opposite way. Extracurricular activities can cause stress by not giving students a break from the school atmosphere. Extracurricular's like art or even sports might seem like they can give students a break from school, but art and sports take up time for students to do individual activities during the week. Some students need breaks from the school atmosphere because it's packed, you have no time to yourself, and some of the students at school might not be very friendly to their fellow classmates. School atmospheres can be very stressful for some students and extracurricular activities would not give them the much needed break they need from it all.\\n\\nExtracurricular activities may benefit others when it comes to participating in school activities, having fun, and filling up free time. Some students might like the idea of joining a sport or doing yearbook club. But some students may not want to participate in extracurricular activities, they may not think any of the activities are fun, and students just may not have the extra time to be able to participate in them. Some students don't think that joining a sport or yearbook club would be fun, or they just don't have the time. Extracurricular activities should be optional because students need to be able to have time for homework, students may not like any of the extracurricular's offered, and they need to be able to take a break from the school atmosphere.</td>\n","      <td>5</td>\n","      <td>708</td>\n","      <td>Mandatory extracurricular activities</td>\n","      <td>Independent</td>\n","      <td>Your principal has decided that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.

For instance, the sports example is limited to a two- to four-hour commitment each day, which might not accurately represent all extracurricular activities.\\n* **Concluding Summary**: The conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and reiterates the student's position against mandatory extracurricular activities.\\n\\nOverall, this essay demonstrates a good understanding of the assignment requirements and presents some strong arguments.

It's unfair to the voters. Changing it to election by popular vote for the president of the United States would be easier for the people.\\n\\nSource 2 states that the Electoral college is unfair for the voters because the candidates don't go to states they don't have a chance of winning, because of the winnner-take-all system. The candidates only focus on the tight races in the swing states. Sorce 2 also claims that in the 2000 election, 17 states didn't see the candidates at all! That's pretty rediculous. And voters in 25 of the largest media markets didn't even get to see a single campaign ad.\\n\\nIn the Electoral College system, voters dont only vote for the president, but for electors, who also vote for the president. Then again, in source 2, the article says the the electors that were voted for can vote for anyone they choose. That's some tricky business.\\n\\nVoters can't control who the electors vote for. Electors aren't even voted for by the people. They sometimes come from state conventions, sometimes the state party's central committee, sometimes even the presidential candidates themselves. The second article says that the legislature is responsible for picking the electors. And these electors coukd always go against what the people want.\\n\\nArticle 1 says that to Electoral college is meant to be a compromise between election of the President by a vote in Congress and election of the President by a popular vote of qualified citizens. The Electoral College consists of the meeting of electors where they vote for President and Vice President, and the counting of electoral votes by congress.\\n\\nDoing away with the Electoral Cololege is the best thing to do for the people. IT's unfair and tricky.

The essay begins with a clear claim supporting the maintenance of the Electoral College, emphasizing that it is \"for the best\" because it is \"unfair to voters.\" However, the main argument shifts towards advocating for change by asserting that the Electoral College can be replaced by election through popular vote without stating or fully addressing the original claim.\\n\\nThe essay effectively uses two sources, integrating them into the discussion of the Electoral College's disadvantages. It cites information about candidates focusing only on swing states during elections and mentions instances where voters in certain regions do not receive visits from presidential campaigns or campaign advertisements. The student also discusses the lack of direct control voters have over electors' decisions.\\n\\nHowever, the essay could benefit from more explicit reference to both sides of the argument, which is particularly weak since it transitions away from supporting the Electoral College mid-way through without a clear rebuttal addressing potential counterarguments against its abolition or modification. The student acknowledges concerns about electors potentially voting contrary to their state's preference but does not fully address this issue.\\n\\nA stronger essay would have balanced the arguments more effectively, critiquing both sides and then presenting a well-reasoned conclusion that supports or refines the position being argued for. In addition, while there is some mention of how the Electoral College works as per Article 1 of the Constitution, this explanation could be expanded upon to provide more context and support for the argument.\\n\\nOverall, the essay demonstrates an adequate grasp of the issue at hand but lacks a cohesive structure that maintains focus on its initial claim. The final grade reflects these aspects, indicating that while there are some strengths in addressing key points and using sources effectively, there is room for improvement in argument coherence and balance.</td>\n","      <td>10.014778</td>\n","      <td>3 (Average)\\n\\nLead: The student began with a clear claim, but it could have been more forceful and engaging to grab the reader's attention.\\nPosition: The student presented their position effectively, using relevant information from source 2 to argue against the Electoral College. However, some details about the benefits of popular vote were missing.\\nCounterclaim: The student acknowledged potential counterarguments in the form of a question and briefly addressed them by stating that electors might not always align with the people's choice. This response could have been more comprehensive in addressing counterclaims.\\nEvidence: The student provided evidence from source 2 to support their position, but they missed opportunities to use other sources for additional evidence or perspectives.\\nRebuttal: The student could have presented a stronger rebuttal by providing further explanation as to why the potential issues with popular vote are not significant and outweighed by its benefits.\\nConcluding Summary: The student provided a clear conclusion, but it lacked a strong call-to-action or final thoughts to leave a lasting impression on the reader.\\nOverall, the essay is well-structured and presents a clear argument, but there are opportunities for improvement in terms of strengthening the position, addressing counterclaims more comprehensively, using multiple sources, and crafting a more impactful conclusion.</td>\n","      <td>7.655927</td>\n","      <td>3 \\n</td>\n","      <td>0.316100</td>\n","      <td>\\nScore: 3/6\\n\\nThe essay lacks a clear and concise claim, making it difficult to understand the writer's stance on the topic.
