Phones & Driving\\n\\nWhile using your phone anywhere sounds like a fun idea, it may not be the brightest idea... while driving. Technology is definitely a stepping-stone for all entertainment as a whole. Back then, in a not so distant past, people had to find things that entertained them, like objects around the room. There honestly was not much to do. Then came the commercial distribution of the home television. Eventually, almost every home in the country had at least one television. At that point, people could watch films and shows from the comfort of their home, instead of getting dirty or injured outside. Many years later came the technological advancement of telephones, known more modernly as smartphones. Smartphones were definitely a huge step in technology, because now you can take your entertainment with you. However... it may not have been the best thing.\\n\\nObviously, with this sort of convenience, people developed a way to multitask while using their smartphones. However, when something requires your utmost attention, like driving, that would be when you should probably put the phone down. However, using Bluetooth to answer calls is highly acceptable. The main problem at hand is looking at your phone while driving; it is a safety hazard. Now, there are pros, just as there are cons.\\n\\nTexting while driving is now just as illegal as not wearing your seatbelt in Georgia. That does not mean you cannot use your phone for other things though. Cell phones have many different tools that can help you. Like a compass, or a clock, or especially a GPS. Obviously, you will not need a compass unless you are following a map in your car. The GPS, however, is a perfectly good example as to why using your phone while driving is a good thing. All you do is enter the address/coordinates and you just follow the route, while occasionally checking your screen to see if you are on track. Perfect for multitasking in the car.\\n\\nNow onto the cons. There are excessively too many cons for you to even consider using your phone while operating a vehicle. The amount of distractions and casualties the problem creates should be more than enough to convince you to put your phone down while driving. Not only are you putting yourself at risk by doing this, but also anyone else who\\'s near you on the road. So many people are injured and/or killed every year because of someone\\'s poor decision to multitask, when their hand should be on the wheel.\\n\\nTo sum it all up, it can be both a blessing and a curse. You benefit from using phones and driving in some ways, but also risk harming others in the process. Texting while driving is not worth more than your well-being. If you are going to bring your phone, at least be smart about it. If not, you might end up like every \"\"texting while driving\"\" story; dead or severely injured. Just... think about it.   \",4,496,Phones and driving,Independent,\"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

Buying cars can be a very tough ordeal for families that have a hard time affording the lives that they live, and by creating a standard bus system, there will be less of a hassle for these families. Also, if the bus and taxi systems are standardized, the busses will all come and depart on a schedule, causing the busses to be more on time and more efficient than having humans drive.\\n\\nSecondly, if there were a large increase in the stadard bus and taxi systems, the usage of gas and oil will drop substantially. Again, this wold help to eliminate one of the pesky bills many families have to pay for but through standard bus and taxi systems, paying for fuel will no longer be a hassle. Also, it is common knowledge that oil and gas are not reusable or nonrenewable resources so by cutting back on the amounts of these resources that are used, there will be a much more stable supply of these resources. Additionally, burning oil and gas has been causing terrible problems for global warming and climate change so by reducing the amounts of these resources used, the climbing rates of global warming will begin to decrease and this problem will then be a thing of the past.\\n\\nLastly, due to all of the technology and research put in to these cars to make them as smart as they truly are, these cars are more able or better suited for life on the road compared to a normal person. In order to make the cars able to drive by themselves (with the slight help of a person) they needed sensors that could determine where it was safe to go and when there was danger ahead. As stated in the passage, \"\"Within 10 years, those sensors had become more advanced to detect and respond to the danger of out-of-control skids or rollovers\"\". When faced with a dangerous situation, these cars have the ability to quickly fix itself and avert from any danger or hazard there was. Because the driverless cars are adapted with this information, it is said that, \"\"The information from sensors can cause the car to apply brakes on individual wheels and reduce power from the engine, allowing far better response and control than a human driver could manage alone\"\". In a time of a crisis or need for diversion, driverless cars are much more suited to take on the situation than cars driven by humans. Driverless cars have features that regular cars cannot manage such as the ability to brake each wheel indiviually. No human could ever be so perfectly ready or able to take on a dangerous situation that they could control each wheel. So, by having technology drive the cars instead of humans, it is considerably safer for the passenegers in the vehicle.\\n\\nIn conclusion, not only is it more intersting to say that there is a car that can self-drive itself, these cars are safer, more efficient, and are more able to create a system similar to taxes or busses. It helps the environment, it helps the needing families, and it helps in the case of a dangerous situation.\",5,682,Driverless cars,Text dependent,\"In the article \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDriverless Cars are Coming,\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the author presents both positive and negative aspects of driverless cars.

Students and teachers are out of school; they are on vacations, visting family, or being with friends! But what about retaining information from the past year, or learning new information, all while you are doing all of your favorite summer activities? Some schools require summer projects during the summer break so that students have an oppurtunity to continue learning over the summer. The summer projects that are completed by students should be student-designed because, it lallows for the student to be more creative and have fun!\\n\\nWhen given the oppurtunity to do a project, students are more likely to complete a project that is based on their creativity. For example, if the student is on an international vacation and left with very little supplies, that student will be forced to be resourceful with his/her resources. With that being said, instead of making the projects teacher-designed, and risking a less creative and boring project, the projects should be student-designed. This will allow the students to come up with their own way of presenting their newly found information through their own creativity with his/her resources.\\n\\nStudent-designed projects give the oppurtunity to make learning fun! A student who is researching information should have a good time while learning the neccessary information to complete to school-required project. For example, if the student is on vacation at a beach, researching information about the ocean, they might go to the beach and explore the natures (all while enjoying their vacation)! The student will not have to stress about finishing their summer project when they get back from their vacation.\\n\\nShould these summer projects be teacher-designed or student-designed? Some might believe that teachers should design the projects so they are more structured and relevent to what they are trying to teach. But, making these projects student-designed, it would make the project more enjoyable for the student, allowing them to be more creative, and have fun!\\xc2\\xa0\",4,318,Summer projects,Independent,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

Driving is a privilege that we earn and lose, this essay discusses the ways to lose and keep the privilege to drive. There are multiple ways to lose the privilege of driving but one way is by using a electronic device while behind the wheel. Most people believe that drivers should not be able to use cell phones,texting,etc. while operating a vehicle.\\n\\nDriving while talking on the phone can get others and the driver hurt. One example could be hydroplaning. Hydroplaning is caused by traction and sliding on a film of water. Using one hand for driving and the other hand for the phone while it\\'s raining is a creation of an accident and getting the privilege to drive taken away. Your driving privileges would be taken away because the driver has a phone in their hand and it\\'s not allowed to have a phone in the vision of the driver behind the wheel.\\n\\nAnother example would be of course texting and driving because once again there is a phone in the hand of the driver instead of both hands on the wheel and no one paying attention to the road. This could lead to an accident because many drivers don\\'t know where they\\'re going and the car could lose control. Driving with a device in your hand is a distraction because your attention should be focusing on your surroundings and the vehicles on the road.\\n\\nTo keep from getting hurt and jeopardizing your life and the life of others,drivers should follow the Hands Free Law. The Hands Free Law is a proposed driving law that states that a driver shall not \"\"record or broadcast a video\"\" on any mobile phones, iPads, computers or touching any part of their bodies while operating a vehicle. Even with the Hands Free technology, drivers are not allowed to write, read, or send any messages or emails, but voice to text is allowed. Voice to text is a form of speech synthesis that converts text into spoken voice output or when the speaker can speak into their device and it translates their words into a text so that the speaker is able to answer the text message or any other important subject.\\n\\nDriving is a privilege. Responsible drivers should always pay attention to the road and other drivers. Cell phones should always be out of the drivers hand so they may maneuver the steering wheel and not drive reckless. Drivers need to remember that driving is a privilege and that it can easily be taken away from you.       \",4,450,Phones and driving,Independent,\"Today the majority of humans own and operate cell phones on a daily basis.

I believe these assignments should be designed by students, and not by teachers. Student-designed summer assignments are more likely to be completed because the students know what they need to learn most, what will overwhelm them, and what types of assignments they can do on their own from experience.\\n\\nIn the eyes of the students, summer is a time when they do not have as many responsibilities to take care of at once, and they can relax from such difficult work. Giving a summer assignment will add to their stress, and take away from their enjoyment of the break. Each student is aware of what type of work stresses them out, and how much work they can do before they\\'re overwhelmed. It is important to their health and well being\\xc2\\xa0for students to be able to take a break from all the pressure they are under during the school year. When students keep in mind that they must take care of themselves and their mental health, they perform better and are more motivated to complete their work.\\n\\nIn the modern world of education, teachers are beginning to incorporate personalized learning into their lesson plans. Personalized learning is any activity that allows a student to learn the material at their own pace. This makes it so students who learn faster can move on as they need to and learn more topics, and the students who need more attention can take the time to truly understand what they are being taught. Summer assignments should be no different from normal personalized learning activities. Only the students understand what level they are at in each subject, therefore if they create an assignment for themselves they will make it challenging, yet manageable. When teachers design assignments they do not keep the needs of every single student in mind, leaving some students behind. Students designing their own summer assignments will make it so no matter what level of education the student is at, they will be growing and learning at their own pace.\\n\\nWhen I was going into tenth grade, I had a summer assignment for my AP World History class. The assignment was incredibly complicated and took over a large amount of my break. While it prepared me for the workload of the class, it made me feel stressed and anxious over whether or not it was what my teacher was expecting. If I had been assigned a project that was designed by a student, I would have felt more at ease about the class and confident in my work. The only resource I had available to me to help me with the assignment was a textbook, meaning that anything I did not understand, I could not get much elaboration on. Student life has changed from what it was when today\\'s teachers were in our position. Every student has experience with different teaching styles and projects, but in general we understand each other better than the teachers do.\\n\\nI believe that if schools require summer assignments, they should be designed by students instead of teachers. Teachers today are unable to empathize with the opinions and feelings of the studentsin a way that helps them grow. Students understand the needs, wants, and experiences of other students, and can therefore create a project that will effectively foster learning over the summer.\\xc2\\xa0\",5,567,Summer projects,Independent,Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break.

For example if a kid decides to try out a sport they could fall in love with it so they work hard at it. So not only could they put that work ethic in the sport they could also put it in the classroom. This can also ready students for the work world when you have to be motivated to do stuff.\\n\\nAnother benefit of every kid doing a extra activity is that it could help get them into a college.

The second reason is because under the Electoral college system, voters vote not for president, but for a slate of electors, who in turn elect the president. The last reason is because the most basic level, the Electoral college is unfair to voters.\\n\\nThe first reason why I think that they need to change the Electoral College to election by popular votes,is because over 60% of voters would prefer a direct election to the kind we have now.
